    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 02, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically in your local assemblies and digitally across the globe, grace and peace be multiplied through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!</p>
<p>I, Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, find myself, by the grace of God, transported into your age—a world buzzing with instantaneous communication, shimmering screens, and knowledge overflowing like a river. I have seen your “memes,” observed your “tweets,” and even glimpsed the potential of these “artificial intelligences.” It is a strange new world, yet the same old human heart beats within it, wrestling with the same questions of faith, purpose, and salvation.</p>
<p>Truly, the words of the prophet Joel ring in my ears with fresh urgency: "I will pour out my Spirit on all people." (Joel 2:28) For I see the Spirit moving even in the digital wilderness, where the Gospel can spread like wildfire across social networks, reaching hearts in nations I only dreamed of. But I also see the shadows lurking there: the echo chambers of misinformation, the addictive allure of fleeting pleasures, and the constant clamor for attention that drowns out the still, small voice of God.</p>
<p>Consider this, my brothers and sisters: you live in a world where algorithms curate your reality, feeding you what confirms your biases and keeps you scrolling. Is this not like the "itching ears" that the apostle warned Timothy about, seeking out teachers who will only tell you what you want to hear? (2 Timothy 4:3) Be wary of this curated reality, for it can blind you to the fullness of God's truth.</p>
<p>I observe the emergence of digital currencies, and a “TrumpCoin” no less, and I recall the warning in Revelation about the mark of the beast, without which no one can buy or sell. (Revelation 13:17) Do not be consumed by fear, beloved! But let this be a reminder that true riches are not found in earthly currencies, but in the treasures of heaven, in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. (Romans 14:17)</p>
<p>I see the Church struggling with relevance in a world that often dismisses its message as outdated. I hear the debates raging about issues of identity, sexuality, and social justice. Remember, my friends, that the Gospel is not a set of rigid rules but a transformative power. It is not a weapon to wield against those who differ from you, but a balm to heal a broken world. Love must be your guiding principle, even when truth is difficult to speak and even harder to hear.</p>
<p>And what of this talk of Artificial Intelligence? I hear some fear that it will replace human intellect and creativity. But I say to you, every human being is a unique expression of God's image, fearfully and wonderfully made. (Psalm 139:14) Let AI be a tool for good, for alleviating suffering, for spreading knowledge, but never let it diminish the value of the human soul, for it is in the human heart that the Spirit of God dwells.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I urge you, in this age of constant connection, to cultivate deeper connections with God and with one another.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unplug</strong> from the digital noise and seek solitude in prayer and meditation. (Matthew 6:6)</li>
<li><strong>Use</strong> technology to spread the Gospel and build community, but be mindful of its addictive nature. (1 Corinthians 6:12)</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong> in honest and respectful dialogue with those who disagree with you, seeking understanding rather than victory. (Ephesians 4:29)</li>
<li><strong>Live</strong> your faith authentically, letting your actions speak louder than your words. (Matthew 5:16)</li>
<li><strong>Remember</strong> that your identity is not defined by your likes, your followers, or your achievements, but by your relationship with Christ. (Galatians 2:20)</li>
<li><strong>Be generous</strong> with your time, your talents, and your resources, remembering that whatever you do for the least of these, you do for Him. (Matthew 25:40)</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> others and be kind even when they are annoying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, my beloved brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Go forth and be salt and light in this world, a beacon of hope in the digital darkness, ambassadors of reconciliation in a world divided.</p>
