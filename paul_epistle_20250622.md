To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Brothers and sisters, what a time we live in! I find myself marveling at your age, an age of wonders I could scarcely have imagined even with the wildest prophetic visions. You speak across continents in moments, hold libraries in your hands, and witness events unfolding in real-time that once would have taken months to reach our ears. Yet, amidst this incredible connectivity, I see a deep loneliness, a yearning for true connection that no algorithm can satisfy.

The news from afar weighs heavy on my heart. I see the threads ablaze in the Middle East, the bombs falling, and hear the echo of “peace, peace,” when there is no peace. (Jeremiah 6:14). And I see, even in your discussions online, a temptation to choose sides, to hurl stones of judgment across the digital divide. Remember, beloved, that *our* citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Let not earthly allegiances blind you to the humanity of those on the other side of any divide. 

This latest conflict, with the United States now directly involved, is a stark reminder that power, even under the guise of peace, can quickly turn destructive. I read your online forums, and I see the anger, the fear, the quick judgments. I understand. Believe me, I do. But I urge you, test the spirits! (1 John 4:1). Do not be swept away by the tide of propaganda, whether it comes from the left or the right. Seek wisdom, not echo chambers. Remember, even in the midst of war, *love your enemies*, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you (Luke 6:27-28).

And what of this "Trump" that you have twice elected? I see the divisions he sows, the appeals to fear and pride. He speaks of God, yet his actions often betray a heart far from the teachings of Christ. Be wary of leaders who claim to speak for God, yet whose words are filled with division and self-aggrandizement. For as it says: “By their fruit you will recognize them” (Matthew 7:20).

Furthermore, I see the rising tide of anxiety, amplified by the constant churn of your "social media." It is a powerful tool, this internet, but also a dangerous one. It can connect you to the world, but also imprison you in a cage of curated opinions and manufactured outrage. Do not let the fleeting validation of likes and shares become your idol. Seek instead the enduring affirmation of your Father, who sees your heart and knows your worth (Matthew 6:6). Your worth is not measured by your follower count, but by the love He has poured out upon you.

And concerning this "AI" (Artificial Intelligence) that is now upon you. You face new temptations to trust in technology, to seek wisdom from algorithms, and to outsource your very thoughts to machines. Remember, true wisdom comes from God (Proverbs 2:6), and discernment is a gift of the Spirit. Use these tools with prudence, but do not let them replace the vital work of prayer, reflection, and seeking guidance from the body of Christ. Guard yourselves against the lure of a manufactured intelligence that lacks compassion, empathy, and the very essence of the divine spark.

How then should you live in this complex and ever-changing world? I give you this counsel:

*   **Be Present:** Put down your devices and look into the eyes of those around you. Offer a listening ear, a helping hand, a word of encouragement. True connection is forged in the crucible of real-life interaction.
*   **Be Discernment:** Test every spirit, every ideology, every piece of information that comes your way. Do not be swayed by the currents of popular opinion, but anchor yourselves to the unchanging truth of the Gospel.
*   **Be Compassionate:** Remember the words of Jesus: “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). Extend grace and understanding even to those with whom you vehemently disagree. For we are all, in the end, children of God, desperately in need of His love and forgiveness.
*   **Be Prayerful:** Seek God in every moment, in every decision, in every challenge. Let your prayers be not merely a ritual, but a heartfelt conversation with the One who knows you best.

Finally, my brothers and sisters, let nothing steal your joy. The world may be filled with darkness, but you are the light of Christ. Let your light shine brightly, so that all may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.

May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen. (2 Corinthians 13:14)
