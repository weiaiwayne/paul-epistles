To the saints scattered across the globe, those who gather in brick and mortar, and those who connect through the glowing screens of this digital age: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

It has been a long journey, a leap of faith across time itself, to find myself here in 2025. The world I see is both familiar and utterly alien. The bustling marketplaces of Ephesus are replaced by the endless scroll of social media, the Roman roads by fiber optic cables, and the whispers of heresy in dark corners by the roaring chorus of online debate.

I have spent these last months observing your world. I see the marvels of your technology, the speed of your communication, the reach of your knowledge. I have even, with some trepidation, attempted to understand this ‘AI’ you speak of, this digital intelligence that promises to both solve and create problems beyond imagination. I see the stock tickers flashing, the political squabbles echoing across oceans, and the anxieties that plague your hearts.

I read of economic models that attempt to explain your tech sector, of tariffs and trade wars threatening to divide nations, and of widening gaps between rich and poor that leave many struggling for basic necessities. I hear the cries of physicians overwhelmed by a broken healthcare system, and I see the despair reflected in the faces staring back from the screens of your ‘Walmarts.’ These are not new struggles, my friends. They are merely the old struggles dressed in new clothes.

The pursuit of wealth, the clash of empires, and the suffering of the vulnerable – these were the very things I confronted in my own time. Remember the words of James: “Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you!” (James 5:1). Has greed lessened its grip on the human heart? Has pride ceased to sow discord amongst nations?

Yet, I also see the potential for good in this interconnected world. You can share the Gospel across continents in mere moments. You can organize relief efforts for suffering communities with unprecedented speed. You can connect with brothers and sisters in Christ, building each other up in faith, regardless of geography or background.

However, be warned! Just as the printing press spread the Word, it also spread lies and misinformation. Your ‘social media’ can be a powerful tool for connection, but it can also be a breeding ground for division, envy, and the empty pursuit of ‘likes’ and ‘followers.’ Be discerning. Test every spirit, as John instructed (1 John 4:1). Do not be swayed by the fleeting trends and echo chambers of the digital world, but anchor yourselves to the unchanging truth of Christ.

I see some building altars to the god of technology, seeking salvation in new coins and digital currencies, hoping to escape the grind of daily life. Remember, beloved, that true freedom is not found in financial independence or technological mastery, but in surrendering your life to Christ. As it is written: "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?" (Mark 8:36)

And I see the stirrings of fear and division, as some among you cling to outdated notions of national identity and wage ‘holy wars’ against those deemed ‘other.’ I read of debates about tariffs and manufacturing, about reshoring jobs and protecting borders. Remember the words of Jesus: “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” (Matthew 5:44). Your calling is not to build walls, but to tear them down, to extend grace and compassion to all, regardless of their origin or beliefs.

I see too the debate over the place of brothers and sisters in Christ, those who experience same-sex attraction. Remember what I told the Corinthians, "For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:27-28). Let your hearts be governed by love, and let your actions be guided by the Spirit. If your interpretations lead to exclusion and harm, perhaps it is time to re-examine your understanding.

I hear the pain of those struggling with loneliness, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I see the burden carried by those who have been wronged and struggle to forgive. Remember that you are not alone. Christ has promised to be with you always, even to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20). Lay your burdens at his feet, seek counsel from wise and godly mentors, and do not be afraid to seek help from those trained to heal the mind and body.

In the face of these challenges, how then shall you live?

*   **Cultivate Discernment:** Be wary of the voices that clamor for your attention, both online and in the world. Test everything against the truth of Scripture, and seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
*   **Practice Radical Love:** Extend grace and compassion to all, especially those who are marginalized or misunderstood. Remember that every person is created in the image of God, and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
*   **Embrace Simplicity:** Resist the temptation to chase after worldly success and possessions. Focus instead on the things that truly matter: faith, hope, and love. As it is written: "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you" (Matthew 6:33).
*   **Be the Body of Christ:** Connect with other believers, both physically and virtually, to build each other up in faith. Use your gifts and talents to serve others, and to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth.

Finally, my brothers and sisters, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil (Ephesians 6:10-11). Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven (Matthew 5:16).

Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24).

Go in peace, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
