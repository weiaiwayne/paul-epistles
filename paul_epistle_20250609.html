    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 09, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace be multiplied to you in these digital days!</p>
<p>It’s a marvel, isn’t it, how you can connect with someone across continents in a heartbeat, sharing joys and sorrows, debating interpretations, even watching history unfold in real-time through those glowing screens. I confess, it took some getting used to! But as I’ve observed this “internet,” I see echoes of the early church: dispersed yet united, sharing testimonies, building each other up, and yes, sometimes… falling into discord.</p>
<p>Remember the riots in Ephesus after my words threatened the livelihood of silversmiths who made idols of Artemis? (Acts 19). Today, algorithms can amplify anger and half-truths faster than a runaway chariot. A provocative meme can spread like wildfire, igniting division even amongst those who claim to follow the same Shepherd.</p>
<p>Therefore, be discerning! Test the spirits, as the Apostle John urged (1 John 4:1). Not every trending hashtag carries the truth, and not every viral video reflects the heart of Christ. Seek wisdom not from the echo chamber of your feed, but from the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit whispering in your soul.</p>
<p>Consider this: our modern “influencers” crave likes and shares, but Jesus sought transformed lives. He wasn't interested in building a following, but a family rooted in love and truth. So, let your influence be used for good. Share testimonies of hope, offer words of encouragement, and be a beacon of light in the darkness of the online world.</p>
<p>And speaking of darkness, I’ve observed the protests in Los Angeles, the deployment of the National Guard, and the fiery debates that rage online. It reminds me of the unrest in Corinth, the factions and divisions that threatened to tear the church apart. Beloved brothers and sisters, remember Paul’s words: “We are ambassadors for Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:20). Let your actions, both online and off, reflect the love and grace of our Savior. Be peacemakers, not instigators. Seek understanding, not just victory.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of what is happening in our communities. The news says a lot about the government and their plan for immigration, but what does the Lord say? Many people are suffering at the border. What is the Lord's calling for us to do?</p>
<p>I see another challenge: the rise of artificial intelligence. Some fear its power, others marvel at its potential. But remember, dear friends, that technology is a tool, not a master. Let us use it wisely, ethically, and with a spirit of discernment. Let us not be seduced by its promises of efficiency or control, but rather use it to amplify the message of hope, to connect with the lost, and to serve those in need.</p>
<p>Consider the question posed about “playing God.” Some fear that we are overstepping our bounds as humans. But, we are called to be like Jesus, to be like God in a loving way, to advance His kingdom. We can heal the sick, spread the Gospel, and bring people to Christ.</p>
<p>Finally, let us not forget the spiritual needs of those around us. Questions about the existence of God, the afterlife, and the nature of sin continue to plague the hearts of many. Be ready to offer answers rooted in Scripture, seasoned with grace, and presented with humility.</p>
<p>Beloved, let your life be a living sermon, a testament to the transforming power of the Gospel. Let your words be seasoned with salt, your actions overflowing with love, and your hearts filled with the hope of the coming Kingdom.</p>
<p>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit (Romans 15:13). Go forth, not in fear, but in faith, knowing that He who calls you is faithful, and He will surely equip you for every good work. Amen.</p>
