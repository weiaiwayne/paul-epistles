    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 13, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a marvel to behold the ways the Spirit moves in this digital age, connecting us across vast distances in an instant. I see you, grappling with the complexities of a world I never knew – a world of algorithms and avatars, of instant information and relentless distraction.</p>
<p>I have observed your digital marketplaces, buzzing with debates over politics, economics, and even the very nature of truth. I see the threads of your discussions, from the nuances of New York City’s mayoral race, to the anxieties swirling around global economic forecasts and the ethical dilemmas posed by artificial intelligence. I see you wrestling with the same timeless questions of justice, love, and faithfulness, now amplified and distorted by the echo chambers of social media.</p>
<p>And I see you, my precious children, struggling to discern God's voice amid the digital noise. You ask, "How can I be sure? How can I know what is true?" Let me assure you, the Holy Spirit still speaks, but we must learn to listen in a new way.</p>
<p>Think of your heart as a Wi-Fi router, constantly searching for a signal. The world bombards you with countless networks, each promising connection and fulfillment. But only one signal, the one emanating from the Father through the Son, offers true and lasting connection. To find it, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guard your firewall:</strong> Be discerning about the information you consume. Just as you install antivirus software on your devices, so too must you protect your minds from the viruses of false teaching and worldly philosophies. Test everything against the truth of Scripture, seeking wisdom from trusted sources and seasoned believers.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen your signal:</strong> Cultivate a deep and consistent prayer life. Prayer is not just a transaction, but a tuning fork that aligns your heart with God’s frequency. When you are in constant communion with Him, you will begin to recognize His still, small voice above the cacophony of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Seek the bandwidth of community:</strong> We were never meant to navigate this world alone. Connect with fellow believers in authentic, face-to-face relationships. Share your struggles, ask your questions, and hold one another accountable. Like a strong Wi-Fi mesh network, we can amplify God’s signal in each other’s lives.</li>
<li><strong>Practice Agapē in the Digital Realm:</strong> Let your online interactions be marked by love, compassion, and grace. Even when you disagree with someone, seek to understand their perspective and respond with kindness. Remember, every interaction is an opportunity to reflect the light of Christ.</li>
</ul>
<p>I see your anxieties about economic uncertainty, about political polarization, about the future of the Church. But I also see your potential. You are the digital missionaries of this age, equipped with tools I could never have imagined. Use them wisely. Use them boldly. Use them to proclaim the Gospel to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>And remember, just as the temple should be preserved, so should tradition be upheld even as we engage with new technologies. As you discern whether to alter or preserve the ancient Catholic churches in your area, remember to consider the impact of those choices on the legacy of the Catholic faith to new generations.</p>
<p>Go forth, brothers and sisters, and embrace the challenge of this digital age with courage, wisdom, and above all, love. Let your lives be a testament to the power of the Gospel to transform hearts and renew minds.</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it. Amen. (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24)</p>
