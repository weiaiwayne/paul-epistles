    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 06, 2025</div>
    <p>To the Saints who gather both in sanctuaries of stone and within the boundless digital cloud, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a marvel to behold the world in which you live! I see the threads of connection spun by your glowing screens, reaching across continents faster than any Roman road. Yet, even as your knowledge expands, I perceive a deep hunger, a yearning for something more substantial than fleeting trends and political squabbles.</p>
<p>I have observed your online "forums," where you debate the meaning of political cartoons and dissect the latest economic pronouncements. Like the Athenians of old, you are eager to hear something new (Acts 17:21). But I urge you, do not let the noise of the world drown out the still, small voice of the Spirit (1 Kings 19:12).</p>
<p>I see your concerns about the "Big Beautiful Bill," and the economy. Remember the words of our Lord: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Matthew 6:19-21). Seek justice, yes, but do not let the anxieties of this world consume you. Let your generosity be a light in the darkness, a testament to the kingdom that is not of this world.</p>
<p>I have also seen your struggles with AI, this "Shoggoth" as some call it, a creation that both dazzles and frightens. Remember, even the most sophisticated algorithm is but a reflection of its creators. Let us not be consumed by fear of the machine, but rather examine the hearts of those who wield its power. Use this new tool for good, to spread the Gospel and to serve your neighbor, but be ever vigilant against its potential for manipulation and division.</p>
<p>And what of the BRICS nations and the shifting economic tides? Let not your faith be shaken by the rise and fall of empires. For our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:20).</p>
<p>I grieve to see the loneliness and despair that plague so many, even within the Church. I have read your cries for help, your struggles with lust, your battles against depression. Know this: you are not alone! The Good Shepherd seeks out the lost sheep, and He will not abandon you in your distress (Luke 15:4-7). Seek out a trusted brother or sister, confess your struggles, and pray for one another. Remember the words of James: "Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." (James 5:16).</p>
<p>And to those of you wrestling with same-sex attraction, know that you are loved by God, just as you are. The path may be difficult, but the grace of God is sufficient to guide you. Seek out affirming communities, and hold fast to the truth that God's love transcends all boundaries.</p>
<p>Finally, I urge you to remember that faith is not merely an intellectual assent, but a living, breathing relationship. Do not be content with simply "believing" in Jesus; seek to <em>know</em> Him, to walk with Him, to be transformed by His love. Read the Scriptures, pray without ceasing, and serve one another in humility and compassion.</p>
<p>Go forth, then, and be the light of Christ in this darkening world. Let your actions speak louder than your words, and let your love be a beacon of hope for all who are lost and searching.</p>
<p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</p>
