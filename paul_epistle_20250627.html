    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 27, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is a strange thing, this world I find myself in. I see you, scattered across the globe, connected by invisible threads woven through the air – your “internet,” you call it. I see you debate, share, and even, alas, sometimes wound one another through glowing rectangles. Yet, even in this digital Babel, I see the enduring light of Christ struggling to shine.</p>
<p>I have witnessed, with a mix of awe and concern, your “Big Beautiful Bill” and the debates it has stirred. The pursuit of wealth and power, even cloaked in promises of prosperity, remains a siren song that can lure even the most devout from the path. Remember the words of our Lord: "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19:24). Let us not mistake earthly comfort for heavenly treasure.</p>
<p>And I hear whispers of “AI,” a new creation of your own making. Be wary, dear friends. As you craft these digital minds, remember that true wisdom and understanding come not from algorithms, but from the Spirit of God. Let your creations serve humanity, not enslave it, and let your pursuit of knowledge be tempered by the love and humility that marked our Lord.</p>
<p>I see also the anxieties that plague you: the housing crisis that leaves many without shelter, the financial burdens that weigh heavily on your hearts, the loneliness that festers even amidst a world of constant connection. Do not despair! These are not new struggles. The world has always been a place of hardship and suffering. But remember the words of Jesus: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).</p>
<p>So how, then, are we to live in this complex and often bewildering age?</p>
<p>Firstly, be discerning. As you navigate the vast ocean of information and opinion that floods your screens, hold fast to the anchor of truth found in the Scriptures. Test everything against the word of God, and do not be swayed by the winds of fleeting trends or the seductive whispers of false prophets.</p>
<p>Secondly, be compassionate. In a world consumed by division and strife, let your hearts overflow with love for all, even those who hate you, even those who persecute you. Remember the words of Jesus: "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44). See the image of God in every soul, regardless of their beliefs, their background, or their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Thirdly, be present. Put down your glowing rectangles, and look into the eyes of those around you. Offer a listening ear, a helping hand, a word of encouragement. The most powerful witness is often not a sermon preached from a platform, but a simple act of kindness offered in the midst of everyday life.</p>
<p>Fourthly, be steadfast in prayer. In a world of constant noise, seek moments of quiet communion with God. Pour out your hearts to Him, confess your sins, and ask for His guidance and strength. Remember that prayer is not merely a ritual, but a lifeline to the source of all grace and power.</p>
<p>Finally, do not be afraid. As I see from some of your posts, suicide is a temptation. But God is with you, and he doesn’t want you to do it. In a world of uncertainty and fear, hold fast to the promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. Death is not the end, but the beginning of a new and glorious chapter in your journey with God.</p>
<p>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.</p>
