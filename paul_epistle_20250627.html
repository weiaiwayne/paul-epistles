    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 27, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I, Paul, once bound by the traditions of my fathers, now a servant of the Most High, greet you from this strange new world. It is a world crisscrossed by invisible threads, a world where voices travel at the speed of light, and where knowledge, both true and false, flows like a mighty river. Miraculously transported to this age of "social media" and "artificial intelligence," I have witnessed wonders beyond my wildest imagining, and also, distressingly, seen old struggles clothed in new garments.</p>
<p>I see you wrestling, my beloved brothers and sisters, with the very same questions that plagued the churches of Corinth, Galatia, and Philippi. The debates over law and grace now rage in comment sections and podcasts. The allure of false teachers whispers through the algorithms of your digital feeds. The temptations of the flesh, amplified by readily accessible images and instant gratification, threaten to shipwreck your souls.</p>
<p>I have observed your "Big Beautiful Bill" and the contentious debates surrounding it. I see the divisions it creates, the anxieties it fuels, and the way it pits brother against brother. Let me remind you, as I reminded the Corinthians, that "God is not the author of confusion, but of peace" (1 Corinthians 14:33). Do not be consumed by the fleeting passions of political strife, but seek instead the enduring Kingdom of God, a kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17).</p>
<p>I have also read with concern your discussions of the Supreme Court. In your debates over justice and the law, remember that earthly courts are imperfect reflections of God's perfect justice. Seek to uphold the law, yes, but let your actions be tempered with mercy and compassion, remembering that "judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful" (James 2:13).</p>
<p>And I have seen your struggles with lust and temptation, laid bare in the digital confessional of your online forums. Do not despair, my friends! The Apostle John wrote, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). But confession is not merely a ritualistic utterance; it is a turning away from sin and a turning toward Christ. Do not be lulled into complacency by the false promise of "moderation" in sin. Flee youthful lusts, pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart (2 Timothy 2:22).</p>
<p>You ask about the "mark of the beast" and the "end times." Fear not the conspiracy theories and sensational pronouncements that abound in this digital age. Instead, focus on the essentials: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind," and "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37-39). Let love be your guiding principle, your mark of identification, your shield against deception.</p>
<p>I hear also the anxieties of those who struggle to believe, who feel disconnected from God, who question the truthfulness of Scripture. To you I say, doubt is not the opposite of faith; it is often a pathway to deeper understanding. Wrestle with your questions, seek wise counsel, and immerse yourselves in the Word. But do not let your doubts paralyze you. Remember the man who cried out to Jesus, "I believe; help my unbelief!" (Mark 9:24). God honors honesty and humility.</p>
<p>Therefore, beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain (1 Corinthians 15:58). Let your lives be a reflection of the Gospel, a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness. Use your technology wisely, not to indulge in fleeting pleasures or to sow discord, but to spread the love of Christ and to build up the body of believers.</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)</p>
