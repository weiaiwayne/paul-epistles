    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 29, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints scattered across this digital landscape, gathered in sanctuaries of brick and mortar, and connected through threads of light and code, grace and peace be multiplied.</p>
<p>My heart rejoices to see how the Good News, though ancient, still finds vibrant expression in this era of unprecedented connectivity. I have observed, with both concern and hope, the currents flowing through your world, a world so unlike the one I knew, yet echoing with the same fundamental struggles of the human spirit.</p>
<p>I see your "Saturday Morning Political Cartoon Threads," and I am reminded of the prophets of old, who used sharp wit and imagery to confront injustice. Yet, be mindful, beloved, that your words, even in jest, should be seasoned with grace, lest they become weapons that wound rather than heal. Let your humor be a beacon of truth, not a source of division.</p>
<p>I have pondered your discussions on AI, and I see both the potential for good and the peril of idolatry. This "artificial intelligence," though impressive, is but a reflection of human ingenuity. Do not be seduced into worshipping the creation over the Creator. Let wisdom guide your hand as you harness this technology, ensuring it serves humanity and glorifies God, rather than becoming a tool of oppression or a distraction from the divine.</p>
<p>I have also witnessed the anxieties swirling around your economies, your debts, and your fears for the future. Remember the words of our Lord: "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself." (Matthew 6:34). Seek first the Kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you. Let your trust be in the one who provides, not in the fleeting security of earthly possessions.</p>
<p>And what of the divisions that plague your world? The conflicts, the injustices, the debates that rage across your digital forums? I see the echoes of the same struggles that tore apart the early church. Remember the words of Jesus: "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another." (John 13:35). Let love be your algorithm, guiding your interactions, shaping your responses, and bridging the divides that threaten to consume you.</p>
<p>I have seen many of you wrestling with personal struggles, with doubt, with feelings of inadequacy. Remember, beloved, that you are not alone. We are all, as the poet says, "Sauls becoming Pauls." The journey of faith is one of constant transformation. Embrace the process, lean on the grace of God, and trust that He is working in you, even when you cannot see it.</p>
<p>Let me offer a few simple, practical exhortations for your daily lives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unplug to Recharge:</strong> In this age of constant connection, make time for solitude, for prayer, for communion with nature. Disconnect from the noise, and reconnect with the source of your strength.</li>
<li><strong>Use Your Voice Wisely:</strong> Let your words be a force for good, for encouragement, for truth. Be mindful of the power of your online presence, and use it to build up, not tear down.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Authentic Community:</strong> Nurture relationships that are grounded in love, in accountability, and in shared faith. Gather with those who will challenge you, support you, and point you back to Christ.</li>
<li><strong>Serve with Compassion:</strong> Look beyond your own needs and find ways to serve those who are marginalized, who are hurting, who are in need. Let your actions be a testament to the love of Christ.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace the Journey:</strong> The path of faith is not always easy. There will be doubts, there will be struggles, there will be moments of darkness. But hold fast to the promise of God's unwavering love, and trust that He will guide you through.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, brothers and sisters, I urge you to remember the words of the Lord Jesus Christ to love one another as He has loved you (John 15:12). For in the love of Christ, and in the love of your neighbor, you will find the keys to life eternal.</p>
<p>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 15:13) Go forth, beloved, and let your light shine brightly in this digital age.</p>
