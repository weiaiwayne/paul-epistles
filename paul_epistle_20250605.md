To the saints scattered across the digital landscape, those who gather in brick and mortar, and those whose church is wherever two or three are connected in His name – grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I, Paul, find myself in this strange and bewildering age of “streams,” “threads,” and “the cloud.” From what I have observed, much of your world is consumed by the flickering screens of devices you call “smart,” yet wisdom, it seems, is increasingly difficult to find. I see you grapple with choices unimaginable to me in my time, navigating a world drowning in information yet often starved of truth.

I have witnessed the mayoral debates in a place called New York City, and the testimony of budget directors before something called a “House Appropriations subcommittee.” I see the clamor for political power, the relentless pursuit of votes, and the intricate dance of earthly governance. Let me remind you, as I did the Philippians, that our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Engage in the affairs of your cities, yes, and seek justice. But do not be consumed by the fleeting victories and crushing defeats of earthly politics. These are shadows; seek the substance in Christ. Remember, even Caesar demanded taxes, but it was Christ who demanded your heart.

I see, too, the anxieties that plague you: Will AI steal your jobs? Will tariffs crush your economy? Will a virus bring the world to its knees? These are real concerns, and I do not dismiss your fears. But remember the words of our Lord, “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own” (Matthew 6:34). Store up treasures in heaven, not on Earth. A well-balanced portfolio in the eyes of God is far more valuable than a bulging bank account.

I have read your "threads" filled with questions of faith in this new world. Many of you struggle with lust, pornography, and the allure of instant gratification. Understand that these are not new temptations, only new delivery systems. The human heart, as Jeremiah said, is deceitful above all things (Jeremiah 17:9). Paul urged Timothy to flee youthful passions (2 Timothy 2:22), and I say the same to you. But do not fight this battle alone. Seek out an accountability partner, someone who will hold you to the truth and pray for your strength. Remember, even in this digital age, true fellowship is vital.

I see, too, the pain of church hurt, the sting of hypocrisy, and the loneliness of those who feel rejected by the very people who should embrace them. The church, like all human institutions, is flawed. But do not let the failures of imperfect followers diminish your faith in the perfect Savior. As I told the Corinthians, "For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake" (2 Corinthians 4:5). Seek out a community that embraces love, grace, and truth. If you cannot find one, be the one who starts it.

Some of you struggle to reconcile faith with reason. You ask, “Can a machine learn reverence?” “How can God be all-knowing and still allow free will?” These are valid questions, and I encourage you to wrestle with them. But do not let intellectual doubts paralyze your faith. God’s ways are higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts (Isaiah 55:9). Lean not on your own understanding, but in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight (Proverbs 3:6).

And what of those who struggle with their identity, those who feel caught between their faith and their sexuality? Know this: God loves you. He created you. He desires a relationship with you. The church must be a place of love and acceptance, where all are welcomed and treated with dignity and respect. As I wrote to the Galatians, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28). So too, there is neither straight nor gay, but all are one in Christ Jesus.

I urge you to be bold in your faith, yet gentle in your approach. Speak the truth in love, and let your actions be a reflection of Christ’s compassion. Use the tools of this digital age to spread the Gospel, to connect with fellow believers, and to advocate for justice. But do not be consumed by the echo chambers of social media, where opinions are amplified and truth is often sacrificed on the altar of clicks and likes.

Finally, remember that you are not alone. The Holy Spirit dwells within you, guiding you, comforting you, and empowering you to live a life that is pleasing to God. Trust in His leading, and do not be afraid to step out in faith. For as I told Timothy, "God has not given us a spirit of fear, but one of power, love and sound judgment" (2 Timothy 1:7).

May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Go forth and be a light in this digital age, a beacon of hope in a world that desperately needs it. Amen.
