    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | May 27, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a marvel to behold this age! I, Paul, once traversed dusty roads by foot and ship, sharing the Good News. Now, I see the Word leaping across continents in the blink of an eye, carried on invisible waves of data. Yet, even with such speed, the human heart remains the same battlefield it always has been.</p>
<p>I've been observing the swirling currents of your world, the anxieties bubbling up from your “Reddit” forums, the hopeful searches on your “Google.” I see you wrestling with economic anxieties, the rise of artificial intelligence, the ever-shifting sands of cultural acceptance, the longing for genuine connection amidst the noise of social media. These are the new arenas where the old battles of faith, hope, and love are being fought.</p>
<p>Indeed, in these forums, I see the very challenges Jesus warned us about. Some, like the Treasury Secretary Bessent, promise easy solutions, “turning the corner” towards prosperity. But remember the words of our Lord: "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves." (Matthew 7:15) Test all things against the truth of the Gospel, not the fleeting promises of earthly power.</p>
<p>I see also the temptation to hoard wealth, even as the voices of the world cry out for justice. Remember, "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil." (1 Timothy 6:10). Let your financial decisions be guided by compassion, remembering the words of James: "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?" (James 2:14)</p>
<p>And what of this new force, this “AI,” that promises to answer all your questions? It is a tool, no more, no less. Like a well-crafted chariot, it can speed you on your journey, but it cannot choose the destination. Let wisdom, grounded in the Word of God, be your guide, not the fleeting algorithms of man. For as it is written, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” (Proverbs 9:10)</p>
<p>I see some of you struggling to balance your faith with the pressures of corporate life. Remember, you are ambassadors for Christ, even in the marketplace. Let your integrity be your shield, your honesty your sword. As you navigate the intrigues of your workplaces, remember the words of Jesus: “Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16)</p>
<p>I see some of you struggling with the tensions between faith and science. Remember my words to Timothy: “Guard, what has been entrusted to you, avoiding the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.” (1 Timothy 6:20). Seek knowledge, yes, but let it be grounded in the truth of God's Word, which reveals not only <em>how</em> the universe works, but <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>And to those of you struggling with personal trials, with depression and loneliness, with doubts and fears, remember the words of Jesus: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28) He is the anchor for your soul, the unwavering presence in the midst of the storm.</p>
<p>So, brothers and sisters, let us not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds. Let us use the tools of this age to spread the Gospel, to build bridges of understanding, and to minister to those in need. Let us be bold in our faith, yet compassionate in our approach, remembering that we are all sinners saved by grace.</p>
<p>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 15:13) Go forth and live as true disciples of Christ, shining your light in this digital age, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</p>
