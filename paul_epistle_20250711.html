    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 11, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, scattered across the globe like stars in a digital firmament: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It has been a marvel to witness, in my brief sojourn amongst you in this year of 2025, the tapestry of your lives. Your world pulses with a connectivity unimaginable in my time. Messages traverse continents in the blink of an eye, and the faces of distant brethren appear on glowing screens, fostering a fellowship that transcends physical boundaries. Yet, even in this age of unprecedented connection, I see the spirit wrestling with familiar foes, albeit cloaked in modern garb.</p>
<p>I have observed your anxieties regarding the advancements in Artificial Intelligence. You fear for your livelihoods, reading headlines that speak of layoffs and slow hiring. Remember, beloved, that true security lies not in the ephemeral promise of human industry, but in the steadfast love of our Father. Just as David, the shepherd boy, was chosen and equipped by God for kingship, so too are you equipped with gifts and talents that no algorithm can replicate. Do not place your faith in the fleeting idol of technological prowess, but seek wisdom and discernment to navigate this changing landscape, always using your gifts to serve the Kingdom. Think not of what you might <em>lose</em>, but of how you might <em>redeem</em> this new technology for the glory of God. Could not AI be used to spread the Gospel to the farthest reaches of the internet, or to translate scripture into languages untouched by human hands?</p>
<p>I see also your weariness with the relentless rise in the cost of living. Comments fly across the digital ether, lamenting high housing and food prices, echoing the ancient cry of "Will prices ever go down?" The apostle James warned us of the dangers of hoarding wealth (James 5:3). While prudent stewardship is essential, let not the pursuit of riches become a master that consumes your hearts. Instead, share what you have with those in need, remembering the words of Jesus: "It is more blessed to give than to receive." (Acts 20:35). Consider supporting local food banks, offering shelter to the homeless, and advocating for policies that promote economic justice. Be the salt and light in a world consumed by greed, and trust that God will provide for your needs, just as He fed the multitudes with a few loaves and fishes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I note the increasing prevalence of what you call "church culture," a phenomenon where the outward performance of faith overshadows genuine devotion to Christ. Many seek the approval of the church community, chasing likes and validation on social media rather than seeking a personal relationship with the Savior. Be wary, my brothers and sisters, of this subtle deception. Remember the words of Jesus: "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me." (Matthew 15:8). Let your faith be rooted in the Word, nourished by prayer, and expressed through acts of love and service, not merely through outward displays of piety. Do not be swayed by the "Christian influencers" who prioritize aesthetics over substance, but seek the true Shepherd who leads you to green pastures and still waters.</p>
<p>I also see a great need for discernment in the face of the many voices vying for your attention. Prophetic YouTubers, AI-generated scriptures, and political ideologies all clamor for your allegiance, promising clarity and certainty in a world shrouded in uncertainty. But remember, beloved, that true wisdom comes from above, not from the algorithms of the internet or the pronouncements of self-proclaimed prophets. Test everything against the Word of God, and let the Holy Spirit be your guide. Just as the Bereans "examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true" (Acts 17:11), so too must you be diligent in discerning truth from falsehood.</p>
<p>Finally, beloved, remember that even in the midst of these challenges, you are not alone. You are part of a global community of believers, united by the love of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit. Connect with one another, both physically and virtually, to offer encouragement, support, and accountability. Just as iron sharpens iron, so too does one person sharpen another (Proverbs 27:17). Seek out genuine fellowship, where you can share your struggles, celebrate your victories, and grow together in faith.</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)</p>
