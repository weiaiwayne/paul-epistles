To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace be multiplied!

Brothers and sisters, as I observe this world of 2025, I am struck by the paradox of connection and isolation. You are woven together by threads of light and fiber, able to communicate across continents in the blink of an eye. Yet, I see loneliness etched on faces scrolling through endless feeds, a yearning for genuine community amidst the digital noise.

I have read your online discussions – the anxieties over economic shifts, the fear of AI displacing human labor, the political divisions that cleave families and churches. I see the game called "Victoria 3" and how one might accidentally build a fashion empire instead of a war machine. I see the debates about the Federal Reserve and the pronouncements of political leaders, echoes of the same power struggles I witnessed in Rome. I see the concerns about low-skilled workers in the face of automation, a modern lament mirroring the anxieties of displaced artisans in Ephesus.

Let me remind you that these are not new struggles. The pursuit of wealth, the clash of empires, the fear of the unknown – these have been the companions of humanity since the fall. But as followers of Christ, we are called to a different path, a higher calling.

Consider this: your social media profiles, those carefully curated reflections of your "best selves," are but pale imitations of the true self we are meant to cultivate in Christ. Your worth is not measured in likes or followers, but in the immeasurable love of God, a love freely given, not earned.

The algorithms that shape your online experience, these subtle forces that nudge you toward certain opinions and desires, remind me of the principalities and powers I warned against. Be vigilant, brothers and sisters! Do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds (Romans 12:2). Let the Word of God be your algorithm, guiding you toward truth, justice, and love.

You fret over the rising tide of AI, the potential loss of jobs and purpose. Yet, I ask you, what is the true purpose of work? Is it merely to amass wealth or status? Or is it to serve one another, to cultivate God's creation, to reflect His image in all that we do? Let us not fear the changing landscape of labor, but instead, embrace the opportunity to redefine work as an act of worship, a testament to the dignity of every human being.

And as I see the two great nations, America and China, dominating the realm of research and development, I am reminded that true innovation comes not from earthly power but from the Spirit of God. Let your minds be filled with wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, so that you may discern what is good and pleasing to God. Let your innovation be guided by love, compassion, and a desire to serve all of humanity, not just a select few.

Some of you struggle with doubts, with the fear that your faith is not strong enough, that you are not worthy of God's love. To you, I say, remember the thief on the cross. In his final moments, he turned to Christ in faith, and he was promised paradise. Salvation is not a reward for perfection, but a gift for those who acknowledge their need for grace.

And to those who wrestle with the complexities of human relationships, with the temptation to judge and condemn, I urge you to remember the words of Christ: "Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone" (John 8:7). Extend grace, offer forgiveness, and love one another as Christ has loved you.

Therefore, beloved, let your lives be a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel. Let your actions reflect the love of Christ, not just in your words, but in your deeds. Let your online interactions be marked by kindness and compassion. Let your pursuit of knowledge be guided by wisdom and understanding. Let your work be an act of service to others.

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.
