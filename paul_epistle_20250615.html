    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 15, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, scattered across the globe yet united in Christ, grace and peace be multiplied to you.</p>
<p>It is I, Paul, your brother in faith, marveling at the ways the Spirit moves even in this strange, new world you inhabit. From my vantage point, observing your "internet" and your "smart devices," I see both immense potential and perilous pitfalls.</p>
<p>Just this past week, I learned of a political assassination in a place called Minnesota. Two lawmakers, targeted for their beliefs, were shot. One was killed, along with her husband. Friends, this is not new under the sun! Remember Abel, slain by his brother Cain? Remember Stephen, stoned for proclaiming the truth? The world will always hate what it cannot understand, but let us not be swayed by fear or violence. Let us instead be known for our love, even for those who persecute us (Matthew 5:44). Forgive them, for they know not what they do.</p>
<p>I see also your "military parades," echoes of the Roman triumphs of old, and your "No Kings" protests, a longing for freedom from earthly rulers. Remember, our true citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Strive for justice, yes, but do not put your faith in political systems. They are fleeting shadows, while the Kingdom of God is an everlasting light.</p>
<p>And then there’s this…this “artificial intelligence.” It reminds me of the Gnostic heresies of my day, promising secret knowledge and wisdom apart from God. Be discerning! This technology can be a powerful tool, but it can also be used to spread misinformation and deception. Test everything (1 Thessalonians 5:21), and hold fast to what is good. Let your knowledge of the Word be your shield and the Spirit your guide.</p>
<p>I see you wrestling with questions of sexuality, with the tension between grace and truth. Remember, we are all sinners, saved by grace alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). But grace is not a license to sin (Romans 6:1-2). Strive for holiness, but do so with humility and compassion. Love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:31), regardless of their choices. Speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15), always seeking to build up, not tear down.</p>
<p>And what of this “climate change” that troubles your hearts? Remember, God entrusted humanity with the care of creation (Genesis 1:28). Let us be wise stewards of the earth, not out of fear, but out of love for God and for our neighbor. Use your technology to heal, not to destroy.</p>
<p>So, how do we live out our faith in this complex age?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be present:</strong> Put down your devices and engage in genuine fellowship with one another. Share a meal, pray together, and encourage one another.</li>
<li><strong>Be discerning:</strong> Use the internet wisely, seeking truth and avoiding the echo chambers of social media. Test everything against the Word of God.</li>
<li><strong>Be compassionate:</strong> Extend grace to those who are struggling, both within and outside the Church. Remember that we are all works in progress.</li>
<li><strong>Be bold:</strong> Speak the truth, but do so with gentleness and respect. Let your actions be a testament to the love of Christ.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, my beloved brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Go forth and shine brightly in this dark world, knowing that you are not alone. He is with you, always, to the very end of the age. Amen.</p>
