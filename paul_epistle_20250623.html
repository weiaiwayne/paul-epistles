    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 23, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints scattered across the globe, those who gather in physical sanctuaries and in the digital cathedrals of the internet, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I, Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, find myself among you, though separated by time, united by the Spirit. I have witnessed wonders in this age unlike any I knew in my own. You speak to each other across vast distances through glowing tablets, carry entire libraries in your pockets, and even create artificial intelligences that mimic the human mind. Indeed, prophecy is fulfilled: knowledge has increased.</p>
<p>Yet, with this explosion of information and connectivity, I see also a new kind of wilderness. The very tools meant to bring you closer can scatter your attention, leaving you adrift in a sea of fleeting images and empty voices. The algorithms that promise connection often deliver only echo chambers, reinforcing division and breeding discontent. I see you, beloved, grappling with anxieties fueled by constant newsfeeds, comparing your lives to the carefully curated portrayals on social media, and wrestling with questions that arise from the ever-changing landscape of this digital world.</p>
<p>The threads of division, I see them woven into the fabric of your societies. Nations rise against nations, fueled by ancient hatreds and amplified by modern propaganda. Conflict rages in the Middle East, stirring up fears and anxieties about the end times. Even within the Body of Christ, I see fractures along denominational lines, political ideologies, and cultural preferences. Let me remind you, as I wrote to the Corinthians, that the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." (1 Corinthians 12:21) We are one body, and when one part suffers, all parts suffer with it.</p>
<p>And what of these new intelligences you create? I see your fascination with Artificial Intelligence, this mirror reflecting back at you the brilliance and the brokenness of the human heart. Some fear it as a tool of control, a potential instrument of the Antichrist spoken of in Revelation. Others see it as a source of boundless potential, a means to solve the world's problems and usher in a new era of prosperity. But remember, beloved, that true wisdom comes not from algorithms or data, but from the Spirit of God, who searches all things, even the deep things of God. (1 Corinthians 2:10) Let discernment be your guide as you navigate this new frontier.</p>
<p>So, what are we to do in this age of both unprecedented opportunity and unprecedented peril? How do we remain faithful in a world that seems to be spinning faster and faster out of control?</p>
<p>First, <strong>cultivate stillness.</strong> In a world of constant noise, make time to quiet your hearts and listen for the still, small voice of God. Turn off the notifications, step away from the screens, and seek solitude in prayer and meditation. As it is written, "Be still, and know that I am God." (Psalm 46:10)</p>
<p>Second, <strong>seek authentic community.</strong> Resist the temptation to build your relationships solely on the shifting sands of social media. Instead, invest in genuine, face-to-face connections with fellow believers. Share your struggles, offer encouragement, and hold one another accountable. Remember, we are called to bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. (Galatians 6:2)</p>
<p>Third, <strong>ground yourselves in truth.</strong> Do not be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, but anchor yourselves in the unchanging Word of God. Study the Scriptures diligently, seeking understanding not just with your minds, but with your hearts. Test everything against the light of the Gospel, and let the Spirit guide you into all truth.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>be agents of reconciliation.</strong> In a world torn apart by division, let your lives be a testament to the unifying power of Christ. Seek to bridge divides, heal wounds, and build bridges of understanding between those who are different from you. Remember, we are all children of God, created in His image and called to love one another as He has loved us.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>remember your citizenship.</strong> While you navigate the complexities of this world, never forget that your ultimate allegiance is to the Kingdom of God. As citizens of heaven, we are called to live lives that reflect the values of that Kingdom: love, justice, mercy, and peace. Let your actions be guided by these values, and let your words be seasoned with grace.</p>
<p>Beloved, I know that the challenges you face are many, and the temptations are great. But I also know that the power of God is greater still. He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. (Philippians 1:6)</p>
<p>Therefore, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen. (2 Corinthians 13:14) Go forth, and let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. (Matthew 5:16)</p>
