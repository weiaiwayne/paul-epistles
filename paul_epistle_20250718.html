    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 18, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both in sanctuaries of stone and in streams of pixels across this digital world, grace and peace be multiplied to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what a time of unprecedented connection and unprecedented confusion we find ourselves in! I see your threads, your posts, your questions echoing across the digital ether. You grapple with the complexities of living a life pleasing to God in a world that often seems determined to drown out His voice.</p>
<p>I see the "Good Trouble" protests erupting, fueled by righteous anger against injustice. Remember the words of Amos: "Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!" (Amos 5:24). But let us also be mindful that even the most noble cause, amplified by the echo chambers of social media, can be corrupted by the very algorithms that spread its message. Search your hearts, ensure your motives are pure, and let love be your guiding star, lest your "Good Trouble" become merely <em>trouble.</em></p>
<p>I see the anxieties rising around AI, these digital prodigies promising to solve all our problems, even offering up AI pastors. But remember, my beloved, the Spirit of God cannot be coded. A chatbot cannot offer the comfort of a hand squeezed in grief, the wisdom gleaned from a life lived in faith, or the conviction of a prophet speaking truth to power. Use these tools wisely, but let them not replace the human connection, the vulnerability, and the messy, beautiful reality of a life lived in community.</p>
<p>I see the yearning for financial security, the frustration of stagnant wages juxtaposed against the obscene wealth of a few. You measure your worth in "cheeseburgers per hour," a stark commentary on the economic realities of your time. Remember the words of Jesus: “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal” (Matthew 6:19-20). Let your pursuit be for righteousness, not riches, and trust that God will provide what you <em>need</em>, even if it's not all that you <em>want</em>.</p>
<p>I see the struggle with "sexual sin," a battle waged in the hidden chambers of your hearts and amplified by the readily available temptations of the internet. Remember, my brothers and sisters, that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. Flee from idols of fleeting pleasure and seek the deeper satisfaction of a life consecrated to God. Lust is a powerful current, but the love of Christ is an even stronger anchor.</p>
<p>And I see, perhaps most poignantly, the loneliness, the doubt, the feeling that God has abandoned you in your darkest hours. You cry out, “Why has Thou forsaken me?” as even our Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross. Remember, beloved, that even in the depths of despair, you are not alone. He is with you, even in the silence. Keep crying out, keep seeking, and keep trusting that He will reveal His purpose in time.</p>
<p>Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain (1 Corinthians 15:58). Let your lives be a testament to His love, a beacon of hope in a world desperately searching for meaning. Use the tools of this digital age to spread His word, to connect with those in need, and to build bridges of understanding across divides. Remember, you are not called to be perfect, but to be faithful.</p>
<p>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.</p>
