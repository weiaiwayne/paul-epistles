    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 04, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically in sanctuaries and virtually in the digital cathedrals of our age – grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>It is a marvel, is it not, how this world shrinks daily? News from distant lands flashes across our screens faster than Philip could travel from Samaria. Discourses unfold in comment threads, rivaling the philosophical debates of Athens, though often with far less wisdom and far more… emojis. We are connected, intertwined in ways unimaginable to those who first received my letters.</p>
<p>Yet, amidst this hyper-connectivity, I see a growing sense of isolation. Like algorithms designed to keep us scrolling, the anxieties of this age – the constant inflation, the looming threat of conflict, the seductive whispers of algorithms promising fulfillment – can trap us in echo chambers of fear and discontent. We see in the news, and in the threads you share, the anxieties over economic futures, the plight of scientists whose research is deemed unworthy, and the rise of tariffs that pit brother against brother in trade wars.</p>
<p>And even within the Church, I observe a fracturing, a Balkanization of belief fueled by unregulated information and a thirst for “truth” that fits neatly within pre-existing biases. I read your online discussions, your struggles to find congregations that both affirm your humanity and challenge you to a deeper relationship with the living God. I see the lure of celebrity preachers promising prosperity, and the pain of those who feel judged, ostracized, or simply unseen.</p>
<p>Therefore, beloved, let us examine ourselves closely. Remember the words of Isaiah (29:13), “These people draw near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.” Are we truly seeking God, or merely a comfortable echo of our own opinions? Are we allowing the algorithms of our own hearts – our desires for ease, for acceptance, for worldly success – to drown out the still, small voice of the Spirit?</p>
<p>The marketplace of ideas, once a place of robust debate, has become a battleground of outrage. Tariffs are not just economic policies; they are spiritual barriers erected between nations, fueled by the greed that Paul warned Timothy about. The pursuit of wealth, as the Master warned, chokes the seed of faith. (Matthew 13:22) Let us not be consumed by the anxieties of this world, for our citizenship is in heaven! (Philippians 3:20)</p>
<p>But do not despair! Even in this digital wilderness, the Spirit offers a wellspring of life. Just as the early Church used the Roman roads to spread the Gospel, we can use these very technologies to proclaim the Good News. Use your platforms to build bridges, not walls. Counter the algorithms of division with algorithms of love. Share stories of grace, mercy, and reconciliation. Let your posts be seasoned with salt and light, drawing others to the truth that sets free.</p>
<p>And for those of you wrestling with doubt, with feelings of inadequacy, with the weight of your past, I remind you of the words of the Master: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28). He does not demand perfection; He offers transformation. He does not condemn your questions; He invites you to seek Him with all your heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, beloved, let us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be discerning consumers of information.</strong> Just as we test the spirits to see if they are from God (1 John 4:1), so too must we test the sources of our news and opinions. Seek truth, not just confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>Be intentional about our online interactions.</strong> Let your words be seasoned with grace, building up rather than tearing down. Remember, a gentle answer turns away wrath (Proverbs 15:1).</li>
<li><strong>Be generous with our resources.</strong> Share with those in need, both physically and spiritually. Remember the words of Peter, urging us to almsgiving.</li>
<li><strong>Be steadfast in prayer.</strong> Pray for our leaders, for our communities, and for one another. For as the body is one, so we must be one in spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Be bold in our witness.</strong> Speak the truth in love, even when it is unpopular. Remember that the light shines brightest in the darkness.</li>
</ul>
<p>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 15:13) Go forth, beloved, not as consumers of the digital age, but as ambassadors of the Kingdom, spreading the love of Christ in every sphere of influence, both seen and unseen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
