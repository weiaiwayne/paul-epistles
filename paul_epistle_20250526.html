    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | May 26, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what a strange and wondrous age we find ourselves in! From the dusty roads of Damascus to the glow of a thousand screens, the message of salvation continues its relentless journey. Yet, I confess, as I observe this world of 2025, I see a new kind of wilderness, a digital desert where hearts thirst for truth but often find only mirages.</p>
<p>I've seen the anxieties swirling around the economy, fueled by headlines proclaiming a "tapped out" consumer. The specter of recession looms, and many of you are feeling the pinch – savings depleted, debt rising, and confidence plummeting. Let me remind you, beloved, that our treasure is not earthly, subject to the whims of markets and the folly of governments. As Jesus said, "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven..." (Matthew 6:19-20).</p>
<p>This doesn't mean we should be indifferent to the plight of those around us. Indeed, as you’ve pointed out in your online forums, the Church must be a beacon of hope in times of economic hardship. Let us be known not for hoarding our resources, but for sharing with those in need. Let us be the hands and feet of Christ, providing practical assistance, offering a listening ear, and reminding our neighbors of the enduring love of God.</p>
<p>I also observe the debates about AI, bots and market algorithms. I urge you to be wise stewards of these tools, not allowing them to dictate your thoughts or actions. Do not be deceived by the allure of instant knowledge or the promise of effortless wealth. Remember, true wisdom comes from above, and lasting riches are found in a life of faith, love, and service.</p>
<p>And what of these heated debates about political ideologies, about who is right and who is wrong? I see you, torn between differing opinions, caught in the crossfire of division. Remember the words of the apostle James: "But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere" (James 3:17). Let us strive to be peacemakers, seeking reconciliation and understanding, even with those who hold opposing views.</p>
<p>And now, concerning the matter of personal struggles – the yearning for connection, the battle against temptation, the weight of past sins. I hear your cries, and I feel your pain. Know this, beloved: you are not alone! Paul himself wrestled with his own imperfections, lamenting, "For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing" (Romans 7:19). Yet, he also proclaimed, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1).</p>
<p>Do not let the tempter convince you that you are beyond redemption. God's grace is boundless, His mercy endures forever, and His love is unconditional. Confess your sins, seek forgiveness, and allow the Holy Spirit to empower you to overcome temptation.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the world may seem chaotic and uncertain, but our hope is secure in Christ. Let us be diligent in prayer, fervent in love, and unwavering in faith. Let us use the tools of this age to spread the Gospel, to connect with one another, and to build up the Body of Christ. And let us never forget that our ultimate purpose is to glorify God and to make Him known to all nations.</p>
<p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</p>
