    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 06, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace be multiplied through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what a time to be alive, eh? We dwell in a world Paul himself couldn't have imagined – a global village connected by invisible threads of light and data. We see empires rise and fall in real-time on our newsfeeds, and the whispers of doubt and division amplify into deafening roars across social media. It’s a digital Colosseum, where truth and falsehood wrestle for our attention, and the roar of the crowd often drowns out the still, small voice.</p>
<p>Remember the exchange between Trump and Musk? A modern-day clash of titans, played out on the very platforms designed to connect us! Such spectacles can easily draw our gaze, leading us into fruitless debates and the seductive trap of choosing sides in worldly conflicts. Yet, Paul reminds us in Ephesians 6:12, “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” These digital dramas, these political squabbles, are often mere distractions from the true battle.</p>
<p>And what of this "AI" that some fear will turn us into "meat robots"? I see it as another tool, like the printing press or the Roman roads, that can be used for good or for ill. Will we use it to spread the Gospel, to connect with those in need, to create art that glorifies God? Or will we allow it to deepen the echo chambers of our own biases, further isolating us from truth and from one another? The choice, beloved, is ours. Let us not be enslaved by the algorithm, but let us use it as a loom upon which to weave a tapestry of love and understanding.</p>
<p>The debates about universal basic income and the future of work remind me of the early church in Acts, where they shared everything so that no one was in need. While we may not agree on the economic solutions, let us not forget the underlying principle: that we are called to care for the poor, the marginalized, and those who have been left behind by the relentless march of progress. As James wrote, "Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?" (James 2:15-16).</p>
<p>And what of those struggling with their faith, those wrestling with doubt, confusion, or the weight of past sins? Remember the words of Jesus: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28). The digital world offers many voices, but it is in the quiet communion with Christ that we find true solace and direction.</p>
<p>So, how do we apply our faith in this bewildering age?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be discerning in your digital consumption.</strong> Filter the noise. Seek truth. Prioritize content that edifies, inspires, and points you toward Christ.</li>
<li><strong>Use technology for good.</strong> Connect with those in need, share the Gospel, and create art that reflects God's beauty.</li>
<li><strong>Be a bridge, not a wall.</strong> Engage in respectful dialogue with those who hold different beliefs. Listen more than you speak. Seek to understand before seeking to be understood.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize human connection.</strong> Put down your devices and spend time with loved ones. Serve your community. Be present in the physical world.</li>
<li><strong>Seek God in the quiet moments.</strong> Cultivate a practice of prayer, meditation, and scripture reading that nourishes your soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I know these are challenging times. But I also believe they are times of immense opportunity. The world is hungry for truth, for hope, for love. Let us be the vessels through which Christ pours out his grace and compassion, both in the digital realm and in the tangible world around us.</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)</p>
