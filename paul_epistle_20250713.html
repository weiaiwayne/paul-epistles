    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 13, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints scattered across the globe, those who gather both in brick and mortar and within the ethereal walls of the digital realm: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is I, Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle. Though I once walked the dusty roads of Palestine, I find myself now, by the grace of God, observing you in this age of wonders, a time of ‘likes’ and algorithms, of instant communication and pervasive connectivity.</p>
<p>I have witnessed your struggles and your triumphs. I have seen you wrestle with the complexities of a world unimaginable to my contemporaries. You face temptations and challenges far beyond those we encountered in Ephesus or Corinth. The very air crackles with distractions, with a cacophony of voices vying for your attention.</p>
<p>I have seen the Saturday Morning Political Cartoon Threads and the debates over tariffs, money transfers, and the Federal Reserve. I see the political divisions, the anxieties over economic policies, and the debates about who your neighbor truly is. You are bombarded with information, much of it twisted and distorted, designed to sow discord and despair.</p>
<p>And yet, amidst this digital maelstrom, I also see the light of Christ burning brightly within you. I see you sharing your faith on social media platforms, offering comfort and encouragement in online communities, and using technology to spread the Gospel to the farthest corners of the earth. I see you wrestling with complex ethical dilemmas, seeking to apply biblical principles to issues like AI, genetic engineering, and environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Consider, my brothers and sisters, that your lives are now lived on a global stage. Your words and actions, once confined to your immediate community, can now ripple across continents in an instant. Like a viral meme, your witness can spread rapidly, impacting countless lives for good or ill. Therefore, be mindful of the content you consume and the messages you amplify. Let your online presence be a reflection of Christ’s love, truth, and grace.</p>
<p>Do you find yourselves losing faith amidst the noise of the world? Remember the parable of the sower. Some seed falls on rocky ground, some among thorns, but some on good soil and bears fruit. Let the word of God be planted in the fertile ground of your hearts, watered by prayer, and nurtured by fellowship with other believers. Do not be discouraged when doubts arise. Even I, who saw the risen Christ, wrestled with my own weaknesses and uncertainties.</p>
<p>And to those struggling with doubt and old habits, take heart! The digital age may offer unprecedented access to temptation, but it also provides powerful tools for accountability and support. Find an online community that will encourage you, challenge you, and pray for you. Use apps to track your progress, set goals, and celebrate victories. And remember, beloved, that God’s grace is sufficient for you. His power is made perfect in weakness.</p>
<p>Above all, remember the words of Jesus: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matthew 22:37-39).</p>
<p>In this age of global connectivity, your “neighbor” is no longer just the person next door, but also the refugee in a distant land, the online troll who spews hatred, and the political opponent who holds radically different views. Love them all, even when it is difficult, even when it seems impossible. For it is through love that we conquer evil, overcome division, and reveal the heart of God to a world in desperate need of His grace.</p>
<p>Now, may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)</p>
