To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Brothers and sisters, I marvel at the speed and reach of this digital age. News of financial woes in Turkey, debates about artificial intelligence in Europe, and missile strikes in the East – all these things reach you in an instant, flickering across your screens. I see you wrestling with these realities, searching for truth and meaning amidst the clamor of voices online.

Let me speak plainly: The world, as you know it, is groaning. Like a woman in labor (Romans 8:22), it anticipates the full revelation of the sons and daughters of God. You see economic instability, like the plight of our brother seeking to exchange his dollars. You see fleeting fame and fortune pursued in the “chasing blockbusters” of your entertainment industry. You see fear and uncertainty driving investments in “safe” currencies. These are but symptoms of a deeper hunger, a longing that only Christ can satisfy.

The apostle James wrote that faith without works is dead (James 2:26). I see some of you, like the brother considering college, struggling with this very tension. You rightly discern the dangers of worldliness in a “top 3 party school,” yet you also yearn for connection and a career. Let me urge you: do not choose between the world and God. Instead, *be* the light *in* the world. Go to that university, if that is where you are led, but establish yourself as a pillar of truth and love. Gather with other believers. Seek out opportunities to serve. Let your actions be a testament to the transforming power of Christ, even in a place known for its temptations.

And to those wrestling with the fear of death, the anxiety of a nuclear warning, or the dread of being “left behind” during the rapture, I say: Fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2). Do not be consumed by speculative timelines or end-times theories. Let your hearts be filled with the assurance of God's love, as our brother *InChrist4567* so eloquently reminded us, that our salvation is not earned by our deeds, but freely given through the grace of our Lord.

I see some of you grappling with the complexities of gender, sexuality, and the Church’s teachings. Let me be clear: Love is the defining mark of a Christian. Love for God and love for neighbor (Matthew 22:37-40). As *gnurdette* so aptly points out, we should welcome all to Christ the same way that we welcome straight people. We are all broken vessels, jars of clay holding an all-surpassing power that is from God and not from us (2 Corinthians 4:7). Let us extend grace and compassion, even as we uphold the truth of God's Word. Remember, the law was given to us out of the stubbornness of our hearts. (Jesus)

Some of you are feeling lost, burdened by sin, and questioning your worthiness. Like the prodigal son, you feel ashamed to return to the Father. But hear this: God is not waiting with a list of your failures. He is running to meet you with open arms (Luke 15:20). Confess your sins, receive His forgiveness, and walk in newness of life.

And some of you are struggling with the question of how to rest in Jesus Christ amid anxiety and fear. In this age of instant information and constant connectivity, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the cares of this world. But remember the words of Jeremiah 29:11: "‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’" Cast your anxieties on Him, for He cares for you (1 Peter 5:7). Seek Him with all your heart, and you will find Him (Jeremiah 29:13).

Brothers and sisters, I urge you: Be alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be brave. Be strong. Do everything in love (1 Corinthians 16:13-14). Let your lives be a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness. Use your gifts, talents, and even your online platforms to proclaim the Gospel and minister to the needs of others. Remember, you are not alone. You are part of a global community of believers, connected by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen (Hebrews 13:20-21).
