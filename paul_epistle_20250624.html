    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 24, 2025</div>
    <p>To the Saints, seen and unseen, gathered in sanctuaries of brick and mortar and across the shimmering landscapes of the digital world – grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is I, Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle. Having been miraculously transported into this age of marvels and anxieties, I have witnessed firsthand the wonders and the perils of your time. I see your struggles reflected in the digital mirrors you hold in your hands, and I hear your questions echoing in the virtual spaces you inhabit. Therefore, I write to you, not on parchment with ink, but with words forged in prayer and tempered by the Spirit, delivered through the very networks that both bind and divide you.</p>
<p>I see the anxieties swirling around you – the specter of wars and rumors of wars reported instantly across continents, the economic anxieties fueled by algorithms and market fluctuations, and the cultural divisions amplified by the echo chambers of social media. Like the Thessalonians of old, you are bombarded with tales of impending doom, prophecies of destruction, and calls to take up arms, both physical and ideological.</p>
<p>Remember, beloved, the words of our Lord: "See that you are not alarmed." (Matthew 24:6). This age, like every age before it, is fraught with challenges. But our hope is not in escaping the world, but in transforming it with the love of Christ. Do not be consumed by fear, but be empowered by faith.</p>
<p>You live in an age of unprecedented connectivity, a global village where information, both true and false, travels at the speed of light. Yet, beware! This same connectivity can become a breeding ground for division and discord. Like the Corinthians, you are tempted to align yourselves with personalities, ideologies, and even algorithms, creating factions and divisions within the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Let me remind you of the wisdom of the apostle James: “But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.” (James 3:17). Let your engagement online be marked by humility, grace, and a commitment to seeking truth, even when it challenges your own perspectives.</p>
<p>Your generation faces unique temptations – the constant allure of fleeting pleasures, the pressure to conform to ever-shifting cultural norms, and the insidious influence of artificial intelligence that seeks to usurp the very image of God in humanity. Yet, these very challenges also present unprecedented opportunities.</p>
<p>Like the early Christians who used the Roman roads to spread the Gospel, you can use the tools of this age to share the Good News with the ends of the earth. Let your social media feeds be filled with messages of hope and reconciliation. Let your online interactions be marked by kindness and respect. Let your digital footprint be a testament to the transforming power of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I hear you wrestling with questions of economic justice, lamenting the disparities in wealth and opportunity that plague your world. Remember the teachings of our Lord, who called us to care for the poor, the marginalized, and the oppressed. Let your actions be guided by a spirit of generosity and compassion, seeking to alleviate suffering and promote justice in your communities and beyond.</p>
<p>And as you navigate the complexities of this age, remember the words of our Savior: “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” (John 13:34-35).</p>
<p>Let love be your guiding principle in all things - in your relationships, your work, your engagement with the world, and even in your online interactions. Let love be the lens through which you interpret Scripture, the foundation upon which you build your lives, and the banner under which you serve Christ.</p>
<p>Now, may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in you what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
