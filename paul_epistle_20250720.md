To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace be multiplied in you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!

It fills my heart to see the ways the Spirit is moving even within the digital currents of this age. I see your threads, your questions, your struggles, and your fervent desires to follow Christ in a world that often seems diametrically opposed to His teachings. I, Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, greet you across the screens and the miles.

I have observed your Saturday morning cartoon discussions, a seemingly lighthearted affair, yet even there, the potent brew of political satire reveals the deep divisions and anxieties simmering within your societies. From kraken-releasing whimsy to stark depictions of power and corruption, the cartoons reflect a hunger for truth and justice. Let us not be naive; these artistic expressions, even in their jest, are cries for righteousness. Remember the words of the prophets of old, who used poetry and allegory to expose the sins of their day. Use your voices, your art, your creativity to speak truth into the digital wilderness.

I see your anxieties about the Fed's renovation, the implications of halted exports and imports, the rising cost of trinkets due to tariffs, and the impossible bootstrap scenarios spun by media moguls. These are the anxieties of a world obsessed with fleeting treasures, a world where the pursuit of earthly security overshadows the pursuit of eternal life. Do not be consumed by these anxieties! Remember the words of Jesus: "Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?" (Matthew 6:25). Let us be shrewd stewards, mindful of our resources, but let us not allow the anxieties of this world to choke the seeds of faith and love in our hearts.

I see your discussions about the Genius Act and cryptocurrency, a new frontier promising freedom and prosperity, yet fraught with the potential for exploitation and deceit. Remember, beloved, that true freedom comes not from technological innovation, but from liberation from the chains of sin. Let your pursuit of innovation be tempered by wisdom and discernment, ensuring that these tools are used for the benefit of all, not just the enrichment of a few.

I hear your yearning for a "Black Wall Street," a thriving economy within a community. Such aspirations are not wrong, but let us not be tempted to build walls of self-sufficiency that exclude the wider world. Remember the parable of the Good Samaritan, who crossed cultural and economic divides to offer compassion to a stranger in need. Let your economic endeavors be rooted in justice and generosity, always seeking to uplift those on the margins.

I see your honest struggles with faith and doubt, with the weight of sin, with the search for purpose. These are not signs of weakness, but rather evidence of a heart that longs for truth. Embrace these struggles, beloved! Wrestle with God as Jacob did, for it is in the crucible of doubt that true faith is forged. Seek guidance from trusted mentors, immerse yourselves in the Scriptures, and never cease to pray for the illuminating power of the Holy Spirit.

I see your concern about those "genius" algorithms and AI. Be mindful of the temptation to blindly trust in technology, or to believe that AI can solve all our problems. Remember, beloved, that true wisdom comes from God, not from code. Let us use these tools with discernment, ensuring that they serve humanity, not enslave it.

I see in your discussions of Hallmark ornaments and the “GENIUS Act” the constant temptation to find security in fleeting things. Be warned! The world will always promise you happiness through consumption, through clever schemes, through political victories. But the only true and lasting joy is found in Christ.

Therefore, beloved, let your lives be a beacon of hope in this age of uncertainty. Be diligent in your study of the Scriptures, but do not be bound by rigid interpretations that stifle the Spirit. Embrace the wisdom of the past, but be open to the new ways in which God is speaking today. Let your love for Christ overflow into acts of compassion, justice, and mercy. Share your faith with boldness, but always with humility and respect.

Finally, my brothers and sisters, let the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Go forth into the digital marketplace, into the bustling city streets, into the quiet corners of your homes, and be a living testament to the transformative power of the Gospel. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.
