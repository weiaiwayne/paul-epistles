To the saints scattered across the globe, connected by fiber optics and held together by the Spirit of God, grace and peace be multiplied to you in this digital age!

Brothers and sisters, I find myself in a world both familiar and utterly foreign. The speed of information, the reach of your “internet,” and the ingenuity of your “artificial intelligence” are marvels to behold. Yet, amidst these wonders, the ancient struggles of the human heart persist, echoing the very battles faced by the early Church.

I have observed your online forums, your news streams, and your cultural trends. I see the same temptations that plagued the Corinthians: division, self-righteousness, and a love of the world's fleeting pleasures. The apostle Paul warned against being “conformed to this world” (Romans 12:2), yet I see many believers mimicking the world’s values, chasing likes and followers, and prioritizing worldly success over eternal significance.

The political landscape! Oh, how it resembles the factions of my own time! You are tempted to align yourselves with earthly kingdoms, forgetting that our true citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Remember, beloved, that while engaging in civic duties is important, our ultimate allegiance is to Christ. Let your actions be guided by love and justice, not by partisan zeal.

I have read of your advancements in science and technology, your explorations of the cosmos, and your unraveling of the human genome. These are gifts from God, tools to be used for His glory. But I also see the danger of elevating human reason above divine revelation. Your "artificial intelligence" can mimic wisdom, but it cannot comprehend the depths of God's love. Your scientific knowledge can explain the mechanics of the universe, but it cannot answer the fundamental questions of meaning and purpose.

Let the Bible, then, be your compass in this age of information overload. Let it guide your hearts and minds, lest you be swept away by the currents of false doctrine and worldly wisdom. Like the Bereans, examine everything carefully (Acts 17:11), testing the spirits to see whether they are from God (1 John 4:1).

I have seen debates raging in your online communities, particularly around issues of human sexuality and identity. The world offers a counterfeit gospel of self-acceptance and personal autonomy, promising freedom but delivering only bondage to fleeting desires. Stand firm on the truth of God’s Word, but do so with compassion and grace. Remember that those struggling with these issues are not your enemies, but souls for whom Christ died. Speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15), offering hope and healing through the transformative power of the Gospel.

As you navigate this complex world, remember the words of Jesus: "I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves" (Matthew 10:16). Be wise in your engagement with the world, but never compromise your integrity or your commitment to Christ.

Therefore, beloved, let us not be weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up (Galatians 6:9). Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:1-2). And may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen (Hebrews 13:20-21).
