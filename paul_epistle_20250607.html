    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 07, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints scattered across the globe, those who gather both in brick-and-mortar sanctuaries and in the digital cathedrals of the internet, grace and peace be with you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is a marvel to behold this age, a time where the world shrinks with every new connection. I see your questions echoing across the digital sphere, questions wrestled with in comment threads and whispered in prayer closets alike. I hear the anxieties fueled by the constant churn of news, the debates raging over tariffs and economic forecasts, the anxieties about the future in a world seemingly spinning faster and faster. Let us take a moment to anchor ourselves in the unchanging truth of the Gospel amidst this digital whirlwind.</p>
<p>I have observed the feuds of your leaders, the Musk and the Trump, and the anxieties they stir within you. Remember, beloved, that the kingdoms of this world are fleeting, built on foundations of sand. Their squabbles are but a shadow play compared to the eternal kingdom of God, a kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17). Do not be swayed by the pronouncements of the wealthy, even when they speak of efficiency and recession. Instead, let your hearts be guided by compassion and a deep concern for all people. </p>
<p>You seek validation in metrics and algorithms, measuring the Church’s success by likes and shares. But I remind you of the widow’s mite (Luke 21:1-4), a small offering seen by few, yet valued immensely by God. True impact is not measured in fleeting online applause, but in the quiet acts of service, the unseen sacrifices of love, the unwavering witness of a changed life.</p>
<p>And what of the algorithms that amplify hate and division? What of the echo chambers that reinforce our own prejudices? Paul wrote to the Corinthians about the importance of tearing down strongholds and taking every thought captive to obey Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). Today, that means being discerning consumers of information, seeking truth beyond the curated feeds, and challenging the narratives that sow discord. Just as you would defend your home from invaders, so too must you guard your minds from the insidious lies that seek to corrupt and divide.</p>
<p>I see you wrestling with complex issues of economics and justice. Remember the words of James: “What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,’ but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?” (James 2:14-16). Let your faith be a catalyst for action, a driving force behind your pursuit of justice and compassion for the marginalized.</p>
<p>I hear your questions about love, about the LGBTQ+ community, about the complexities of sin. Remember the words of Jesus: “By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:35). Love, not judgment, is the hallmark of a follower of Christ. Hold fast to the truth, but temper it with compassion and empathy. Engage in respectful dialogue, seek to understand, and above all, let love be your guide.</p>
<p>Beloved, I see your struggles with addiction, with loneliness, with the constant pressure to conform. Know this: you are not alone. Christ is present in your struggles, walking alongside you, offering strength and solace. Reach out to one another, build communities of support, and remember that the battle against sin is a lifelong journey, not a sprint to perfection.</p>
<p>Therefore, I urge you, saints of the digital age, to live out your faith with boldness and humility, with discernment and compassion. Share the Gospel in word and deed, challenge injustice, and love one another fiercely. Remember that you are ambassadors of Christ, called to be salt and light in a world that desperately needs both.</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen (Hebrews 13:20-21). Go forth, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
