    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 11, 2025</div>
    <p>To the Saints scattered across the globe, those who gather both in brick and mortar and in the digital ether – grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, what a strange and wondrous age we live in! I find myself, as I observe your world of 2025, both marveling at its ingenuity and lamenting its distractions. You communicate across continents in the blink of an eye, wielding devices that hold more knowledge than the libraries of Alexandria. Yet, so many are lost in the endless scroll, chasing fleeting validation in the echo chambers of social media, and mistaking the curated highlight reel for the fullness of life.</p>
<p>I see you wrestling with tariffs and trade wars, feeling the pinch in your purses as nations bicker and leaders make decisions that ripple across the global marketplace. Remember the words of Jesus: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven..." (Matthew 6:19-20). Let not the fluctuating markets steal your peace, but let your hope be anchored in the unshakable Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>I hear the anxieties swirling around Artificial Intelligence, whispers of technological disruption and fears of being rendered obsolete. Let me remind you that true worth is not found in skill or efficiency, but in the image of God imprinted upon your soul. Embrace the gifts of innovation, but do not let them define your humanity. Use these tools to amplify love, to connect with the lonely, and to share the Gospel with those who dwell in digital darkness.</p>
<p>I see the divisions amongst you, even amongst those who claim the name of Christ. Political ideologies become idols, and the unity of the Spirit is sacrificed on the altar of partisan fervor. Remember my words to the Corinthians: "For where envy and self-seeking exist, there is confusion and every evil practice" (James 3:16). Let love be your guiding principle, and seek to build bridges of understanding, even with those who vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>And I see the longing in your hearts, the ache for purpose and meaning in a world saturated with fleeting pleasures. You search for validation in likes and followers, but true fulfillment is not found in the approval of strangers. It is found in the quiet communion with your Creator, in the selfless service to your neighbor, and in the unwavering pursuit of righteousness.</p>
<p>Some of you struggle with doubts, feeling distant from God, questioning the very foundations of your faith. Remember the words of the Psalmist: "My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever" (Psalm 73:26). Draw near to Him in prayer, even when you feel nothing. Read the Scriptures, not as a burden, but as a lifeline. Seek out fellow believers who will walk alongside you, offering encouragement and accountability.</p>
<p>And some of you, dear brothers and sisters, struggle with the weight of sin, with the persistent pull of temptation, with the feeling of being unworthy of God's grace. Remember my words to the Romans: "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38-39). Confess your sins, embrace His forgiveness, and press on toward the goal of Christlikeness, knowing that His grace is sufficient for you.</p>
<p>Therefore, beloved, let your faith be a beacon in this age of uncertainty. Use your technology to spread the Gospel, not to indulge in vanity. Let your actions be guided by love, not by fear or prejudice. Let your lives be a testament to the transformative power of Christ, a living sermon that speaks louder than any digital post.</p>
<p>Finally, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen. Go forth and live as lights in a dark world, knowing that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</p>
