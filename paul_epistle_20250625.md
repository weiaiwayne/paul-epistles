To the saints scattered across the digital landscape and those gathered in physical fellowship, grace and peace be multiplied from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!

It is I, Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God. I marvel at the ways the Spirit continues to move, even in this age of glowing screens and instant connection. From my vantage point, observing your world of 2025, I see a landscape both familiar and strangely new. The core struggles of the human heart remain – faith, doubt, love, and fear – yet they are amplified and distorted by the very tools meant to connect us.

I see the inventory of homes for sale rising, echoing the anxieties of a world built on shifting sand. You build your lives on foundations of financial security, yet the markets rise and fall like the tides. Remember the words of Jesus: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Matthew 6:19-21). Are you investing in eternal treasures, or chasing the fleeting gains of this world?

I see the specter of war and the unsettling dance of political instability dominating your news feeds. The comments sections, those digital arenas of strife, echo with the same tribalism that plagued Corinth. You argue over headlines and political figures, forgetting that our citizenship is in heaven. Let your words be seasoned with grace, even when engaging with those who oppose you. Remember, we are called to be ambassadors of reconciliation, not warriors in a digital culture war.

And I see the allure of the intangible economy, this shift from physical goods to virtual assets. While innovation can be a gift, be wary of chasing fleeting digital empires. Let your focus remain on the things that truly matter: love, compassion, and service to others. A virtual handshake can never replace the warmth of a helping hand.

I have observed the rise of AI, this creation of your ingenuity, and it reminds me of the idols of old. Powerful, captivating, and ultimately lifeless. Do not let these tools become your gods, demanding your worship and stealing your affections. Use them wisely, but remember that true wisdom comes from above, from the one who created all things.

I see the Church grappling with complex issues of identity, sexuality, and inclusion. The threads of these debates are woven throughout your online forums. Remember, beloved, that we are all one in Christ Jesus. Do not let cultural trends divide you. Instead, seek unity in the Spirit, building bridges of understanding and compassion, even when you disagree. Let love be the guiding principle, remembering that it covers a multitude of sins.

And to those struggling with addiction, with lust, with rage, know that you are not alone. The tempter prowls like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world! (1 John 4:4). Flee from temptation, fix your eyes on Jesus, and surround yourselves with a community of believers who will hold you accountable and lift you up.

Finally, I see among you those who feel lost, who cry out for a sign, a word, a touch from the Almighty. To you, I say: He is not silent. Open your hearts, quiet your minds, and listen. He speaks in whispers, in sunsets, in the laughter of children, and in the still, small voice within.

Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.
