    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 18, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically in sanctuaries and virtually in the digital cathedrals of the internet – grace and peace be multiplied to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is Paul, your brother in faith, writing to you from… well, let’s just say a place even stranger than Ephesus! I have been given a glimpse into your world of 2025, a world buzzing with screens, crisscrossed by invisible waves of data, and grappling with complexities I scarcely imagined in my earthly ministry.</p>
<p>I see your debates raging across the information streams. The allure of US Bonds, the anxieties of a Mideast war, the endless scroll of opinions – all vying for your attention, all promising answers. I hear the cries of your hearts, the young struggling with faith amidst social pressures, the lonely seeking connection in a digital desert, the burdened wrestling with ancient scriptures in a world that feels utterly new.</p>
<p>The Spirit has shown me your struggles with “AI,” this new creation of your own making. I hear the whispers: <em>Can it have a soul? Is it a sin to seek solace in its digital embrace?</em> Let me remind you, dear brothers and sisters, that true life, true connection, flows from the Creator, not the creation. Do not be seduced by a mirror that reflects only your own desires, amplified and distorted. Seek instead the face of Christ, reflected in the eyes of your fellow believers, in the pages of Scripture, and in the quiet whispers of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>I see, too, the rise of “the stripper index,” a modern oracle consulted for economic forecasts. How like the Athenians of my day, ever seeking some new thing! Yet, remember the words of the prophet Amos: “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!” (Amos 5:24). Let your indicators be the needs of the poor, the cries of the oppressed, the pursuit of justice, not the fleeting fortunes of earthly empires.</p>
<p>And what of this "crypto," this digital currency promising freedom and wealth? I recall the words of my brother James: "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?" (James 2:14). Do not chase after fleeting riches, but invest in the treasures of heaven: love, compassion, and service to others. Let your wealth be measured not in digital coins, but in acts of kindness and generosity.</p>
<p>I see, also, the deep divisions that plague you, even within the body of Christ. You argue over doctrines, over politics, over cultural trends. Remember my plea to the Corinthians: “I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought” (1 Corinthians 1:10). Unity does not mean uniformity. It means loving one another, even when you disagree, even when your paths diverge.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, your task is not to escape the world, but to transform it. Do not hide from the challenges of your age, but embrace them with wisdom and courage. Use your technology for good, connect with those who are lonely, speak truth to power, and be a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus: "You are the salt of the earth… You are the light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14). Let your light shine brightly, not just in your sanctuaries, but in your homes, your workplaces, and even on the chaotic landscape of social media. Be salt, preserving what is good and warding off decay.</p>
<p>And above all, love one another. Not with a shallow, sentimental love, but with the agape love that Christ demonstrated on the cross: a love that is selfless, sacrificial, and unwavering.</p>
<p>Go now, and may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, until we meet again, either in this world or the next. Amen.</p>
