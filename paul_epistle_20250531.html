    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | May 31, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints scattered across this digital landscape, those who gather in sanctuaries of brick and mortar, and those who meet in the cloud of shared connection: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is a marvel to behold this age, this era of instant communication and boundless information. From my vantage point, plucked from the dust of a bygone time, I see the threads of human nature, both glorious and flawed, woven into the very fabric of your “internet.” I observe your “Reddit” threads, your “C-SPAN” streams, your pronouncements on “Truth Social” and other platforms – a cacophony of voices striving for connection, for understanding, for truth.</p>
<p>I have witnessed, for example, a discourse regarding a meeting between a leader named Trump and an entrepreneur named Musk. I see in this the echo of earthly powers seeking to understand and even harness the gifts and influence of others. But remember, beloved, that true power resides not in the Oval Office, nor in the hands of those who control the flow of information, but in the One who humbled Himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross.</p>
<p>I see, too, your anxieties about the economy – your struggles to afford groceries, to pay your mortgages, to navigate the complexities of a world increasingly driven by artificial intelligence. I hear the cries of those who feel lost in the digital wilderness, those who long for connection and purpose in a world that often seems cold and indifferent. I read of debates about the ethics of AI, about its potential to create or destroy, to empower or enslave. Consider, beloved, the warning of Philippians 2:4, "Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others." Technology, like all things, must be tempered by love and used for the benefit of all, not just a select few.</p>
<p>And I have noted your deep concern for the vulnerable, the marginalized, the immigrants and refugees seeking solace within your borders. I hear the debates about laws and borders, about justice and mercy. Remember the words of Jesus, who, though familiar with the letter of the law, was never bound by its spirit when it clashed with compassion. "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," He declared. Let love be the guiding principle, even amidst the complexities of governance and policy. Remember Deuteronomy 10:19, "And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt."</p>
<p>I see discussions about what is sin and what is not, what brings us closer to God and what alienates us. I see the echoes of legalism, the temptation to judge and condemn, the longing for clear-cut answers in a world that often presents itself in shades of gray. Remember, beloved, that grace is not a license to sin, but a transformative power that empowers us to live in obedience to God. Seek not to condemn, but to encourage, to uplift, to walk alongside your brothers and sisters in their journey toward holiness.</p>
<p>What, then, are we to do amidst this digital din? How do we navigate this complex world while remaining faithful to the Gospel?</p>
<p>First, let us be rooted in the Word. These ancient texts, though written in a different time, speak to the timeless truths of the human heart. Let them be the compass that guides you through the storms of your age.</p>
<p>Second, let us cultivate a spirit of discernment. Not everything that glitters is gold, and not every voice that shouts the loudest speaks the truth. Test all things, hold fast to what is good, and abstain from every form of evil.</p>
<p>Third, let us love one another with a fervent heart. Let our actions be a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel, let our words be seasoned with grace, and let our lives be a reflection of the love of Christ.</p>
<p>Fourth, let us seek justice for the oppressed, compassion for the suffering, and mercy for the lost. Let us be a voice for the voiceless, a refuge for the weary, and a beacon of hope for the despairing.</p>
<p>Finally, let us never cease to pray. For prayer is the lifeline that connects us to the source of all wisdom, all power, and all love.</p>
<p>Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</p>
