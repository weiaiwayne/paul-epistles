To the saints in Christ Jesus, scattered throughout the nations, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I give thanks to my God always for you, making mention of you in my prayers, because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. For this reason, ever since I heard about you, I have not stopped praying for you, asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. And I pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

Brothers and sisters, my heart is grieved as I see the confusion that reigns in this present age. For many are tossed back and forth by every wind of doctrine, led astray by false teachers who twist the Scriptures to suit their own desires. They preach a gospel of prosperity and ease, promising health and wealth to those who follow them. But I say to you, do not be deceived! For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

I hear also of those among you who are consumed by the spirit of fear, paralyzed by the anxieties of this world. They tremble at the prospect of economic collapse, political turmoil, and social upheaval. But I say to you, do not be afraid! For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-discipline. Cast all your anxiety on Him, for He cares for you. Trust in Him with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding.

Moreover, I am troubled by the rise of extreme views that divide and polarize you. Some among you cling to rigid ideologies, demonizing those who hold differing opinions. Others embrace a false tolerance, compromising the truth for the sake of acceptance. But I say to you, let your love be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo yourselves in honoring one another. Live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be tender-hearted, be humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.

Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. Let all that you do be done with love.

Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joyâ€”to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.

Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus.
