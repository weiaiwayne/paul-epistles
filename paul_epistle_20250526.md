To the saints scattered across the world, those who gather in physical sanctuaries and digital spaces, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Brothers and sisters, what a strange and wondrous age we inhabit! I see the threads of the ancient world woven into the fabric of this new one, the same struggles echoing through time, albeit with a digital beat.

I have watched, with both awe and concern, as this thing you call the "internet" connects you across continents in an instant. You share thoughts, ideas, and even experiences in ways unimaginable to me in my own time. Yet, I also see how easily this connectivity can become a breeding ground for division, a marketplace of fleeting trends that distract from the eternal truths.

I hear your questions echoing across the digital void: *“Is crypto a threat to the US financial system?”* you ask, and I say, remember the words of Jesus: "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven…" (Matthew 6:19-20). Let wisdom guide your investments, and let your heart not be consumed by the pursuit of fleeting riches.

I read of an AI chatbot for economics and the stock market, and I ponder, where is the wisdom and understanding that comes from God, not just from algorithms? Remember, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding" (Proverbs 9:10). Seek knowledge, but seek God first.

I see the anxieties rising in your hearts as you discuss the economic woes, the rising debt, and the tariffs. I hear the cries of those struggling to find work, and those burdened by the weight of student loans. Know this: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?" (Matthew 6:25). Seek justice, care for the vulnerable, and trust in the God who provides.

Some among you ask, “Is it a sin to be ‘freaky’ with your spouse?” I remind you of Paul's words: "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure" (Hebrews 13:4). Let love and respect be the foundation of your intimacy, and let the Holy Spirit guide your desires.

I see those wrestling with addiction, those struggling to return to the faith, and those tormented by their past. To you, I say, do not despair! "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). There is always hope for redemption, always a path back to the loving embrace of our Savior.

I am grieved to see reports of violence against Christians in Egypt and the rise of defense spending and war. Remember, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9). Let love guide your actions, and let your voice be raised for justice and reconciliation.

Even now, there are those who misuse the Scriptures to justify hatred and division, particularly against those who are different. I remind you of the words of Jesus: "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you" (Luke 6:27-28).

I read of your struggles, your joys, your questions, and your doubts. I see the threads of faith being woven into the tapestry of this new age. I urge you: do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds. Let the Holy Spirit guide your steps, and let the love of Christ be your compass.

As you navigate this complex world, remember the words of Paul: "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things" (Philippians 4:8).

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.
