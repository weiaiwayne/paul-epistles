To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!

It is a marvel to me, even after witnessing the wonders of the ancient world, to see how far the tendrils of the Gospel have stretched in this digital age. From the humblest village to the bustling metropolises fed by fiber optic cables, the message of Christ resonates, even amidst the noise and distractions of your 2025.

I have been observing the threads of your online discussions, the anxieties woven into your news feeds, and the questions that plague your hearts. I see the tariffs squeezing your markets, the specter of economic hardship looming, the debates over national debt, and the ever-present hum of division. I hear your fears about AI, the uncertainties of climate change, and the anxieties about losing faith in a world that seems increasingly chaotic.

I see the Church wrestling with these things too. I see the debates over economic policies, the divisions over cultural issues, and the struggle to reconcile ancient truths with modern realities. Some of you, like the Corinthians of old, are divided over leaders and interpretations, forgetting the unifying power of Christ's love. Others are tempted to conform to the world, blurring the lines between righteousness and sin.

Remember this: We are not called to be Luddites, clinging to a bygone era. Nor are we called to blindly embrace every fleeting trend. We are called to be *transformed*. As you navigate the complex algorithms of your social media feeds, remember Philippians 4:8. Filter your thoughts through the lens of truth, honor, justice, purity, loveliness, and excellence. Let these principles be the firewalls that protect your minds from the corrosive influence of the world.

Consider this: Your smartphones, capable of connecting you to billions, are also capable of disconnecting you from the very people sitting beside you. Your ability to share opinions instantly can amplify both truth and falsehood. Your access to boundless information demands a greater need for discernment. Don't let the echo chambers of the internet drown out the still, small voice of the Holy Spirit.

The Apostle Peter wrote of suffering for doing good (1 Peter 3:17). Know that even in the midst of economic downturns or political strife, your faith is not rendered obsolete. It is tested, refined, and made stronger. Remember the words of the prophet Habakkuk (3:17-19), who declared that even if the fig tree does not bud, and there is no yield in the stalls, he would yet rejoice in the Lord. Your joy is not dependent on earthly prosperity, but on the unshakeable foundation of God's love.

And concerning the debates about the "national debt" and economic theories, remember that true wealth is not measured in currency, but in compassion, justice, and love. As you engage in discussions about economic systems, let your actions reflect the heart of Christ, who cared for the poor, healed the sick, and challenged the status quo.

As for the divisions within the Church, I urge you, as I urged the Corinthians, to be of the same mind. Not in lockstep uniformity, but in genuine love and unity of purpose. Remember that your diversity is a strength, not a weakness. Embrace your differences, but let them be tempered by the unifying power of the Gospel.

Therefore, beloved brothers and sisters, stand firm. Immerse yourselves in the Word, pray without ceasing, and let your love for God overflow into love for one another. Let your lives be a testament to the transforming power of the Gospel, a beacon of hope in a world desperately searching for light.

Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)
