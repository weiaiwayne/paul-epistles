    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 12, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is a strange and wondrous thing, to witness the Church scattered across the globe, yet connected by unseen threads of the "World Wide Web," as you call it. From the bustling streets of Los Angeles, amidst the revelry and fleeting troubles of the LA Carnival, to the quiet corners of bedrooms where souls search for answers online, you are a body, a family, knit together in Christ.</p>
<p>I have observed your anxieties, your debates, and your longings through this "internet" of yours. I hear your voices, echoing across digital forums, wrestling with the weight of nations drowning in debt, the fear of economic collapse, and the uncertainty cast by the rise of artificial intelligence. I see the questions that plague your hearts: <em>If the economy crashes, how do I provide? If AI takes my job, what is my worth? If I only want to work enough to make $15,000 a year, should I pay income taxes?</em> These are modern echoes of ancient anxieties, dressed in the garb of your time.</p>
<p>Remember, the apostle James wrote, "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?" (James 2:14). The answer, then as now, is clear: faith without action is a signal without a receiver, a profile without a purpose. The coming debts, the potential job losses, these are not reasons for despair, but opportunities for action. Learn new skills, support local businesses, and share your resources with those in need. Don't hoard your talents; be the best plumber, programmer, waiter, or venture capitalist you can be. Be a beacon of light and a source of hope in the midst of uncertainty.</p>
<p>I also see your ethical dilemmas, amplified by the speed and reach of technology. The rare earth minerals needed for your missiles and fighter jets, the digital Euro versus US stablecoins, the cuts in aid to Ukraine – these are complex issues that demand careful consideration. Do not be swayed by fleeting trends or political ideologies. Instead, seek wisdom from the Scriptures, pray for discernment, and let love be your guiding principle. Remember, "Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10).</p>
<p>The question of AI-generated music, the rise of stablecoins, and the trade wars between nations are all new battlefields in an old war. The temptation to hoard wealth, to exploit others, to seek power at any cost – these are ancient sins, now amplified by the technology at your fingertips. Be vigilant, brothers and sisters. Use your "smart phones" and "social media" not to spread discord and division, but to build bridges, to share the Gospel, and to be a voice for the voiceless.</p>
<p>And what of your personal struggles? I see your battles with lust, your fears about the future, your questions about heaven and hell, and your anxieties about same-sex attraction and gender identity. These are not new struggles, but they are now amplified by the constant bombardment of information and temptation. Remember, the apostle Paul wrestled with his own "thorn in the flesh," (2 Corinthians 12:7) and yet he remained faithful to Christ. Do not be discouraged by your failures. Confess your sins, seek forgiveness, and press on toward the goal. And find a community where you can be honest and vulnerable, where you can be held accountable, and where you can find support and encouragement.</p>
<p>Many of you are asking how to find God's will for your lives. You are questioning your purpose, your direction, and your value. Remember, you are not defined by your career, your relationships, or your accomplishments. You are defined by your identity in Christ. "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Seek Him diligently, and He will guide you.</p>
<p>Finally, remember the Great Commission. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Share the good news of Jesus with your friends, your family, your neighbors, and even with strangers you meet online. Be bold, be courageous, and be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.</p>
