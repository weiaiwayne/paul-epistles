    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | June 21, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>What a time we live in, brethren! I marvel at the speed with which information, both truth and falsehood, travels across the globe. You hold in your hands devices more powerful than the libraries of Alexandria, yet are often lost in a sea of fleeting trends and curated realities. The digital marketplace, like the agora of old, offers a feast of knowledge, but also a breeding ground for deceit and distraction.</p>
<p>I have observed your online discussions, the anxieties swirling around Supreme Court decisions, economic anxieties, and the relentless churn of news. I see the debates about AI, the fear of job displacement, the allure of quick riches in cryptocurrency, and the pervasive sense of dread that seems to hang in the digital air. I have even witnessed the rise of new idols, not carved from stone, but forged in the fires of social media validation and algorithmic manipulation.</p>
<p>The Apostle John warned against loving the world and the things in the world (1 John 2:15). Understand this: the "world" he spoke of is not the creation that God declared "good," but the system that operates <em>apart</em> from God, driven by greed, lust, and the insatiable hunger for power. This system, amplified by technology, seeks to ensnare you in its endless cycle of consumption and comparison.</p>
<p>Consider the "lump of labor fallacy" debate I saw discussed. The concept that there's a fixed amount of work to be done is a lie that breeds fear and scarcity. The truth is, creativity and innovation, driven by the Spirit, can unlock new opportunities and create abundance. Don't be swayed by the whispers of economic despair! Instead, ask yourselves: "How can I use my gifts, empowered by the Spirit, to build up the Kingdom and serve my neighbor in this new landscape?"</p>
<p>And what of the anxieties surrounding population decline? Remember, our strength lies not in sheer numbers, but in the quality of our love and the depth of our faith. A small, faithful remnant, ablaze with the Spirit, can move mountains. Look at South Korea’s situation, or that of any nation struggling with low birth rates. The answer isn't simply to reproduce blindly, but to create societies where families are valued, where children are nurtured, and where the love of Christ shines brightly.</p>
<p>Even the "boomerang hire" trend speaks to a deeper truth. While the world seeks efficiency and profit, the Church should prioritize redemption and restoration. Are we willing to offer forgiveness and second chances, even to those who have stumbled? Do we value experience and wisdom, or are we caught up in the relentless pursuit of the "new?"</p>
<p>And what of the debates surrounding interpretations of scripture, the endless arguments between dispensationalism and covenant theology? Brethren, let us not be consumed by theological minutiae while neglecting the weightier matters of justice, mercy, and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23). Remember the Pharisees, skilled in the law but blind to the heart of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, I urge you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be discerning with your consumption:</strong> Guard your minds against the constant barrage of negativity and temptation. Seek out truth, beauty, and goodness, not just what confirms your own biases.</li>
<li><strong>Use technology for good:</strong> Harness the power of the internet to spread the Gospel, connect with fellow believers, and serve those in need.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate authentic community:</strong> Prioritize face-to-face interactions over virtual connections. Seek out genuine fellowship, where you can be known, loved, and challenged to grow.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace practical service:</strong> Put your faith into action. Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the sick and imprisoned. Let your love be tangible and transformative.</li>
<li><strong>Seek wisdom and understanding:</strong> Study the Scriptures diligently, but also engage with the world around you. Learn from history, science, and the arts. Let your faith inform your understanding of all things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, remember that you are not alone in this battle. Christ has overcome the world (John 16:33). He has given you the Spirit to guide you, the Church to support you, and the Word to illuminate your path.</p>
<p>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.</p>
