    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | May 29, 2025</div>
    <p>To the Saints who gather both in sanctuaries of stone and in the ethereal spaces of the internet, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I, Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, find myself, by the grace of God, a sojourner in your time, 2025. Miraculously transported, I’ve been observing your world, a world both wondrous and bewildering, a world connected by threads of light and code, yet often fractured by division and fear.</p>
<p>I see you, brothers and sisters. I see your struggles with the ever-present screens, the endless scroll feeding you both knowledge and anxiety. I see the debates raging online, the political strife mirroring the factions that plagued even the early Church. And I see, too, the yearning for truth, the hunger for connection, the desire to live a life that matters, a life pleasing to God.</p>
<p>Let me speak plainly, as I always have, though mindful of the need for compassion. The spirit of the age whispers seductive lies. It tells you that <em>self-care</em> is the ultimate virtue, that your <em>personal brand</em> is your most valuable asset. It promises fulfillment in fleeting pleasures and security in earthly possessions. But I remind you, as I reminded the Corinthians long ago, “The world in its present form is passing away” (1 Corinthians 7:31). To chase after these things is to build your house on sand, destined to be swept away by the storms of life.</p>
<p>You fret over the rise of artificial intelligence, fearing its potential to displace workers and distort truth. Indeed, there is cause for concern. Yet, consider this: even the most sophisticated AI, capable of generating convincing text and art, is but a hollow echo of the true Creator. It can mimic intelligence, but it cannot possess the wisdom, love, and compassion that flow from the Spirit of God. Do not be mesmerized by technological prowess, but rather use these tools with discernment, always seeking to amplify the voice of truth and to build bridges of understanding, not walls of division. Remember, "I have the right to do anything," you say—yes, but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything," but not everything is constructive." (1 Corinthians 10:23).</p>
<p>I read of your political divisions, the tariffs, the accusations of corruption, the fears of economic collapse. These are not new struggles. Even in my own time, Caesar’s shadow loomed large, and the temptation to place faith in earthly rulers was ever-present. But I urge you, saints, do not be consumed by the battles of this world. Your citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Seek justice, yes, but let your actions be motivated by love, not by hatred or the desire for power. Remember the words of our Lord, “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36).</p>
<p>I see some of you wrestling with what others tell you of the end times, the rapture, and the like. Some of you, I see, are even having nightmares about it. Let me remind you what Christ taught, "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." (Mark 13:32). Stay vigilant, keep your heart open to Christ, but do not let fear and speculation rob you of the joy and peace that is your inheritance.</p>
<p>And to those who struggle with questions of sexuality and gender, know this: God’s love extends to all. He desires a relationship with each of you, regardless of your identity or past. The call to holiness remains, but it is a call to transformation, guided by the Spirit, not a condemnation based on rigid adherence to legalistic rules. As you seek to understand God’s will for your life, cling to the words of Jesus: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these” (Mark 12:30-31).</p>
<p>Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain (1 Corinthians 15:58). Let your love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor (Romans 12:9-10).</p>
<p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</p>
