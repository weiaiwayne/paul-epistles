To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!

It is a wonder, isn't it, this age in which you find yourselves. I, Paul, still marvel at how swiftly news travels, how readily one can connect with brethren across continents, and how vast the storehouses of knowledge have become. Yet, even in my day, the world seemed ripe with distractions and temptations, a constant tug-of-war between the spirit and the flesh. How much more so must it be in your time, with your glowing screens and endless streams of information!

I've been observing your "internet," this digital agora, and I see both incredible potential and grave peril. It can be a powerful tool for spreading the Gospel, for building community, and for mutual edification. Think of it as a modern-day road system, extending the reach of the Good News to the uttermost parts of the earth, as the Lord commanded. Yet, this road is also filled with potholes, detours, and bandits waiting to ambush the unsuspecting traveler.

I see you grappling with the nuances of "AI," this new creation of your minds. Some of you hail it as a tool to enhance understanding, to translate scripture, and to even craft sermons. Others fear it as a soulless mimicry, a false prophet whispering empty promises of knowledge and connection. I urge you to be discerning. Test every spirit, as John wrote (1 John 4:1), and remember that true wisdom comes from God, not from algorithms. Let AI be a servant, not a master.

And then there are the "influencers," those figures who command attention and shape opinions in your digital world. I see some of you aspiring to emulate them, to build your own platforms and amass followers. While there is nothing inherently wrong with sharing your faith online, be wary of chasing fame or validation. Remember the words of Jesus: "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" (Matthew 16:26). Let your influence be rooted in humility, service, and love, not in likes and subscribers.

I also see you struggling with division, even within the Body of Christ. Political ideologies, cultural preferences, and denominational distinctions often create walls where there should be bridges. Remember, we are all members of one body, and if one part suffers, we all suffer (1 Corinthians 12:26). Seek unity in the essentials of the faith, and let love be the guiding principle in your disagreements. As I wrote to the Philippians, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves" (Philippians 2:3).

And what of your leaders? I see the rise of "entrepreneurs of faith," those who amass wealth and power in the name of God. Be wary of such individuals, for they often prioritize earthly gain over heavenly treasure. A true shepherd cares for the flock, not for personal enrichment. Test their teachings against Scripture, and look for the fruit of the Spirit in their lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).

The challenges are great, brethren, but so is the opportunity. You are called to be salt and light in a world that desperately needs both. Use your technology wisely, engage in respectful dialogue, and above all, cling to the love of Christ, which surpasses all understanding.

Finally, I know some of you struggle with the weight of sin, with the feeling of being unworthy of God's grace. Let me remind you that God's love is not conditional. It is not earned, nor can it be lost. As David wrote in Psalm 103:12, "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us." Embrace the freedom that comes with forgiveness, and let it empower you to live a life of love and service.

May the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. May you be filled with the Spirit, empowered to witness to the world, and united in love with all who call upon the name of the Lord. Go forth, and be His light in this digital age!

Your brother in Christ,

Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
