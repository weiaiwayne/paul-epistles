To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Brothers and sisters, it is I, Paul, writing to you from a strange and wondrous time – 2025! I have seen things that would have been beyond even the wildest imaginings of the prophets of old. Your little devices, these “smart phones,” are more powerful than the libraries of Alexandria, and your ability to connect with one another across continents is akin to the very breath of the Spirit moving across the earth.

Yet, even with all this marvel, I see the same struggles, the same temptations, the same yearning for truth that plagued the souls of the Corinthians, the Galatians, and the Philippians. The tools have changed, but the human heart remains a battlefield.

I have been observing the discourse online, and I am troubled by the anxieties that grip so many of you. I see debates over economic forecasts, concerns about political divisions, and a constant striving for validation in the fickle world of “likes” and “followers.” I read your questions about the rising influence of AI, the shifting moral landscape, and the relentless pressure to conform to the norms of a world that often seems to have lost its way.

Let me speak plainly: The GDP formula, the pronouncements of politicians, and the fleeting trends of social media are but shadows. Do not be consumed by them. Remember the words of our Lord: “What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?” (Matthew 16:26). Your true wealth lies not in your bank accounts or your online influence, but in the treasure you store up in heaven (Matthew 6:20).

Some of you wrestle with the question of what is sin and what is not, especially regarding matters of the flesh. Know this: God is not a cosmic rule-keeper, merely ticking off boxes on a heavenly checklist. He desires a relationship with you, a deep and abiding communion of the heart. Do not be enslaved by legalism or fear. Instead, ask yourselves: “Does this action draw me closer to Christ, or does it pull me further away?” (1 Corinthians 10:23). Let love be your guide, not the anxiety of judgment.

And to those who struggle with feelings of doubt, despair, or even demonic oppression, I say: Do not yield to the darkness! Even when the storm rages and the waves crash against your fragile vessel, remember the words of Jesus: “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid” (John 14:27). Claim the authority you have in Christ, speak truth to the lies that assail you, and seek the fellowship of other believers who can lift you up in prayer.

Do not be deceived by the voices that tell you that you are alone, that your struggles are unique, or that God has abandoned you. The words of the Psalmist still ring true: "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit" (Psalm 34:18).

Let your social media feeds be not echo chambers of division, but platforms for grace. Let your conversations be not fueled by anger and condemnation, but by compassion and understanding. Let your actions be not driven by fear, but by faith in the power of Christ to transform even the darkest corners of this world.

And finally, remember the words of the hymn, “Be Thou My Vision”: let Christ be the vision of your heart, your wisdom, your treasure, your very best thought, both when you wake and when you go to sleep.

Brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.

I, Paul, write this with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
