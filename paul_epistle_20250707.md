To the saints scattered across the world, those who gather in brick and mortar and those who connect through the shimmering threads of the internet, grace and peace be with you.

It’s Paul here, writing to you from… well, let’s just say I’m experiencing firsthand the warp-speed of your 2025. It's a marvel to witness the interconnectedness you possess, a global village buzzing with information and opinions. I see you, scrolling through endless feeds, navigating the algorithms, and striving to make sense of it all.

I've been observing the anxieties that plague your hearts. The earth groans under the weight of environmental damage, like the rare earth industry's toxic legacy in China. The pursuit of wealth, symbolized by your "Wall Street Radar" and the frenzy around stocks, often overshadows the call to care for the least of these. The rise of AI presents both incredible opportunities and daunting questions about the value of human labor, echoing the ancient anxieties about idols replacing true worship. And the partisan spirit, the "America Party" and endless political squabbles, threatens to tear the very fabric of community, just as it did in Corinth.

Some of you, I see, are wrestling with the same timeless questions: the nature of salvation, the persistence of sin, the problem of suffering, the role of women in the church. These are questions that have echoed through the ages, and I rejoice that you continue to grapple with them, seeking understanding and truth.

But I also see that the enemy still prowls, seeking to devour. He whispers lies in the echo chambers of social media, preying on your fears and insecurities. He offers fleeting pleasures that leave you empty and ashamed, like the addiction to pornography so many of you struggle with. He sows seeds of doubt, tempting you to despair when prayers seem unanswered and the future feels uncertain.

So, what are we to do in this digital wilderness? How do we live out our faith in a world that is both incredibly connected and profoundly fractured?

First, remember the bedrock: **love**. Not the fleeting, fickle emotion of a trending meme, but the *agape* love, the self-sacrificing love that Christ embodied. Love must overflow! This love doesn’t just tolerate; it actively seeks the good of the other, even when they are different, even when they are difficult. As I wrote to the Galatians, "For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" (Galatians 5:14)

Second, **be discerning**. Use your reason, sharpened by the Spirit, to evaluate the information that floods your senses. Don't be swayed by the "algorithm" of popular opinion. Study the Scriptures, pray for wisdom, and seek counsel from trusted brothers and sisters in Christ. Remember the words of my brother James; "be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." (James 1:22)

Third, **cultivate authentic community**. While digital connections can be valuable, don't let them replace face-to-face fellowship. Seek out genuine relationships with other believers who will challenge you, support you, and hold you accountable. Visit the sick, help the poor, and share the gospel with those who have never heard. As you journey, remember to “Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you” (Colossians 3:13).

Fourth, **find your purpose in the midst of the chaos**. You may not know exactly what God has called you to do, but He has given you gifts and passions that can be used for His glory. Whether you're a history student turned law student, a firefighter in training, or a struggling teen battling temptation, seek to live out your faith with integrity and excellence. "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters." (Colossians 3:23)

Finally, **remember that you are not alone**. Even when you feel lost, tired, or overwhelmed, Christ is with you. He has promised never to leave you nor forsake you (Hebrews 13:5). Lean on Him, trust in His love, and allow Him to guide you on your journey.

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.
