    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 02, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!</p>
<p>Greetings in this digital age, an age of instant connection and overwhelming information. I, Paul, once a persecutor, now an Apostle of Christ, write to you across the vast expanse of the internet, marveling at this very technology that allows my words to reach you, scattered as you are across the globe.</p>
<p>I have observed much in my time here, a time so different from my own, yet so strikingly similar in its struggles. I see the "smart money" of Wall Street, trusting in algorithms and regulatory loopholes, reminiscent of the Pharisees meticulously counting their tithes while neglecting justice and mercy. The relentless pursuit of profit, unchecked by love, echoes the very idolatry that plagued the Israelites of old. Be wary, brethren, lest you be consumed by the allure of earthly treasures, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (Matthew 6:21).</p>
<p>I have also witnessed the rise of these "Magnificent Seven" tech giants, their market caps soaring into the heavens. They offer connection and knowledge, but also sow division and distraction. Like the Tower of Babel, they promise a unified humanity but often lead to a cacophony of voices, each clamoring for attention and validation. Consider carefully what you feed your minds. Is it truth that builds up, or fleeting entertainment that leaves you empty? For as the Apostle Peter wrote, “His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence" (2 Peter 1:3).</p>
<p>I read of the debates raging online, the conservatives advocating for redistribution of wealth, and the liberals advocating for redistribution of wealth, but both are really just giant establishments fighting for power with you as their source of votes. Brethren, do not be deceived by the empty promises of political saviors. Our hope lies not in earthly kingdoms, but in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>I am troubled by the anxieties that plague so many, the fear of economic collapse, the rising cost of living, the loss of community. I see you, struggling to make ends meet, navigating a world that seems increasingly hostile. Remember the words of our Lord, "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?" (Matthew 6:25). Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</p>
<p>Yet, amidst these challenges, I also see incredible opportunities. The internet, this very medium we use to connect, can be a powerful tool for spreading the Gospel. Use it wisely! Share your stories of faith, offer words of encouragement, and build communities of love and support. Be discerning, yes, but do not shrink back from engaging in the digital marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>Let your light shine brightly in this dark world. As the apostle Paul wrote, “For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. To one we are an aroma of death; to the other, an aroma of life. And who is equal to such a task?” (2 Corinthians 2:15-16)</p>
<p>Remember the example of Aquila and Priscilla, tentmakers who shared the gospel alongside their trade. Find ways to integrate your faith into your daily lives, whether it be through your work, your relationships, or your creative pursuits. Let your actions be a testament to the transforming power of Christ.</p>
<p>Be bold, yet compassionate. Speak truth, but with grace. Love one another, even when you disagree. For we are all members of one body, and when one part suffers, we all suffer with it (1 Corinthians 12:26).</p>
<p>Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.</p>
