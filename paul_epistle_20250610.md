To the saints who gather both physically in sanctuaries and virtually across the digital landscape, grace and peace be multiplied to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

It has been a time of great wonder and, frankly, some bewilderment since I found myself thrust into your age of 2025. I have observed your ways, your tools, and the very fabric of your existence woven with threads of instant communication and boundless information. The speed at which news travels, the reach of your "social media," and the burgeoning intelligence of your "AI" are truly marvels, yet they also present profound challenges to the soul.

I see you grapple with issues that, while dressed in modern garb, echo the ancient struggles of faith. The pull of worldly success, now amplified by the constant highlight reel of curated online lives, tempts you to measure yourselves against fleeting standards. The cacophony of voices vying for your attention, the endless scroll of opinions, and the echo chambers of online communities threaten to drown out the still, small voice of the Spirit.

Indeed, the very technology designed to connect you can also isolate you, leading to a loneliness more profound than any I witnessed in my own time. I see you searching for identity in the fleeting validation of "likes" and "shares," forgetting that your true worth is found not in the approval of the digital crowd, but in the unwavering love of the Father.

And what of this new idol, this "AI"? It promises knowledge, efficiency, and even companionship. Yet, beware lest you place your trust in algorithms and data, forgetting that true wisdom comes not from lines of code, but from the divine Word, etched upon the heart. It is a tool, yes, but a tool that can easily become a master, demanding your time, your attention, and ultimately, your very soul.

More troubling still, I observe a preference for girls over boys, a choice that perverts God's design and threatens the very foundations of family and community. This is but another sign of the world's confusion, a rejection of the natural order and a pursuit of vanity.

Therefore, let us be reminded of the timeless truths of the Gospel. Just as I urged the Corinthians to flee from sexual immorality, I urge you to be diligent in guarding your hearts against the temptations of this age. Just as I warned the Galatians against the false teachers who sought to pervert the Gospel, I urge you to be discerning in what you consume, both in the physical and the digital realms.

How then shall we live in this age of wonders and perils?

*   **Be Present:** Put down the devices, turn off the notifications, and be truly present with those God has placed in your life. Cultivate genuine relationships, face-to-face, heart-to-heart.
*   **Be Discerning:** Test every spirit, every message, every trend against the Word of God. Do not be swayed by the fleeting winds of popular opinion, but stand firm on the bedrock of truth.
*   **Be Generous:** Use your technology not just for personal gain, but to serve others. Share the Gospel, offer encouragement, and be a light in the darkness.
*   **Be Humble:** Remember that all you have is a gift from God. Do not boast in your knowledge, your success, or your possessions, but give thanks to the One who makes all things possible.
*   **Be Accountable:** Find a community of believers who will challenge you, encourage you, and hold you accountable. We are not meant to walk this path alone.

Let the words of the hymn resonate in your hearts: “Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely dim, in the light of His glory and grace.”

Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it. Abide in Him, and may His love guide you always.

Grace be with you all. Amen.

Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, present in your time.
