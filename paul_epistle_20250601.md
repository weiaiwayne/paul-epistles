To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, scattered across this digitally woven world, grace and peace be multiplied from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!

Greetings! It is I, Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God. I find myself, miraculously, amidst the vibrant, bewildering landscape of 2025. The speed with which information travels, the sheer volume of voices vying for your attention, it is… well, it is like nothing I could have ever imagined in my earthly ministry.

I've been observing your “Saturday Morning Political Cartoon Threads,” your economic anxieties, your ethical debates on AI, and your heartfelt struggles with faith in the face of suffering. I see your attempts to reconcile ancient wisdom with modern challenges, and my heart is stirred, both with joy and with a familiar concern.

I see the political cartoons – clever, biting, often fueled by righteous indignation. But be warned, my brothers and sisters, lest your hearts become consumed by the fleeting passions of this age. Let not your hope be pinned to earthly saviors or earthly kingdoms. Remember, our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20), and our ultimate allegiance is to the King of kings.

I see your anxieties regarding the economy, the fears of losing your livelihoods, the debates over trade and tariffs. Remember the words of our Lord, “Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?” (Matthew 6:25). Strive for righteousness, and trust that God will provide for your needs. For as you seek His Kingdom first, all these things will be added to you (Matthew 6:33).

I see your debates on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence, a creation of your own ingenuity, now threatening to surpass your own understanding. Remember that God's Spirit has given us a sound mind – use it! (2 Timothy 1:7). Test all things; hold fast to what is good (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Let wisdom and discernment guide your technological advancements, ensuring they serve humanity, not enslave it.

And I see your aching hearts, wrestling with suffering and doubt, your cries for understanding in the face of loss. You ask, "Why does God allow suffering?" My answer, though insufficient to fully comprehend the mysteries of God, echoes through the ages: God's ways are not our ways, and His thoughts are not our thoughts (Isaiah 55:8-9). Yet, even in the darkest valley, He promises to be with us, a shepherd guiding us through the shadows (Psalm 23:4). Lean on Him, not on fleeting emotions or logic alone. Faith is not a feeling; it is a choice, a commitment to trust even when you cannot see.

Some of you ask about ancient texts and apparent contradictions. Remember this, the power of God is not in the letter, but in the Spirit. Our faith should be living and active.

Some of you seek ways to love more fully, to break free from toxic relationships, to find your place in a world that often feels broken. Remember the words of our Lord, "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35). Let love be your guiding principle, your compass in a world of shifting values.

And to those who are losing faith, who feel distant from God – do not despair! Remember the prodigal son, who, in his darkest hour, turned back to his father, and was welcomed with open arms (Luke 15:11-32). God's love is relentless, His grace boundless. He is waiting for you to return.

So, beloved, let us not be consumed by the anxieties of this age, but let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2). Let us use the tools of this age – the digital connections, the instant communication – to spread the Gospel, to encourage one another, and to build up the body of Christ. Let us be bold in our witness, yet compassionate in our approach, always speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).

Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)
