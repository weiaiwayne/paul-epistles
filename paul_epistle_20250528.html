    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | May 28, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Greetings from this strange and wondrous age of glowing screens and instant connection. I, Paul, once traveled by foot and ship, spreading the Gospel through dusty roads and perilous seas. Now, I see your words flash across continents in mere moments, a network of voices – sometimes harmonious, often discordant – all vying for attention in the digital agora.</p>
<p>I’ve witnessed your “metathreads,” your “AMAs,” your endless scroll of opinions and updates. I see you wrestling with questions of political bias, navigating the labyrinthine rules of online forums, and grappling with the implications of technologies like AI and genetic engineering. It reminds me of the vibrant, chaotic marketplaces of Corinth and Ephesus, only magnified a thousandfold.</p>
<p>Let me speak plainly: this “digital wilderness” is not inherently evil, but it is a dangerous place. Just as the idols of old tempted the Israelites, these modern distractions – the endless stream of information, the fleeting validation of likes and shares, the echo chambers of polarized opinions – can subtly draw you away from the true and living God. Remember the words of Jesus: "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" (Mark 8:36). This applies just as much to the digital world as it does to the physical.</p>
<p>Some of you ask about the legitimacy of sources, the presence of "bad actors" spreading vitriol. Brothers and sisters, remember the parable of the wheat and the tares (Matthew 13:24-30). Do not be consumed with weeding out every dissenting voice. Instead, focus on sowing seeds of truth, love, and righteousness in the digital soil. Let your words be seasoned with grace (Colossians 4:6), and let your actions be guided by the Spirit.</p>
<p>I see you struggling with the concept of free will in light of God's omniscience. Some argue that if God knows all, then our choices are predetermined, rendering our agency meaningless. But consider this: a skilled chess player can anticipate their opponent's moves several steps ahead, yet that doesn't negate the opponent's freedom to choose. God's knowledge does not dictate our actions; it simply acknowledges the choices we will make. It is a testament to His divine wisdom, not a constraint on our liberty.</p>
<p>And what of the suffering in the world, the seemingly pointless pain inflicted upon the innocent, both human and animal? Remember the words of Romans 8:22: "We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time." The world is broken, yes, but God is not absent. He is working, even in the midst of chaos, to bring about His ultimate redemption. Your task is not to understand every mystery, but to trust in His unfailing love and to be a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>Some of you grapple with the tension between faith and reason, between spiritual experiences and empirical evidence. Let me remind you that faith is not blind obedience; it is a reasoned trust in the character of God. Seek knowledge, yes, but do not elevate human intellect above divine wisdom. The heart that is open to the Spirit will find truth in both the laboratory and the prayer closet.</p>
<p>And to those struggling with sin – with lust, with addiction, with feelings of inadequacy – know this: you are not alone. The battle against temptation is a lifelong struggle, but it is not a struggle you must wage in your own strength. Draw near to Christ, confess your sins, and allow Him to transform you from the inside out. He offers not just forgiveness, but power to overcome.</p>
<p>Finally, as you navigate the complexities of this modern world, remember the core principles of the Gospel: love God, love your neighbor, and proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ. Let your digital footprint be a reflection of your faith – a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel in a world desperately searching for truth, meaning, and hope.</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)</p>
