    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 19, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints who gather both physically and virtually, grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>I find myself, in this strange new age of yours, marveling at the very things that also trouble you. Your "internet," this vast web of connection, echoes the very Body of Christ in its potential for unity and shared purpose. Yet, like the church at Corinth, it can also be a breeding ground for division, gossip, and the pursuit of worldly approval, what you call "likes" and "followers."</p>
<p>I see you wrestling with the ethical dilemmas of technologies I could scarcely imagine. Artificial intelligence, with its promise of efficiency and innovation, also raises questions about human dignity, the value of labor, and the very nature of truth. Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that all things are to be tested (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Does this new tool serve love, justice, and the common good, or does it amplify the voices of the powerful and further marginalize the vulnerable? Does it promote genuine connection or cultivate isolation and a craving for fleeting validation?</p>
<p>And what of this "metaverse" and these virtual worlds that beckon with the promise of escape? While recreation and fellowship are good gifts, do not be deceived into thinking that digital substitutes can ever replace the tangible reality of human touch, the shared breaking of bread, or the embodied presence of Christ in the midst of His people. For it is in the physical gathering, in the messiness of real human interaction, that we truly learn to bear one another's burdens and become living epistles of God's grace.</p>
<p>I see, too, your anxieties about economic instability, the exploitation of workers, and the widening gap between rich and poor. The questions you grapple with are not new. The early church faced similar challenges, and their response was radical generosity, sharing their possessions to ensure that no one was in need (Acts 4:32-35). As you navigate the complexities of your globalized marketplace, remember the words of James: "Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?" (James 2:15-16). Your faith must be more than just words; it must be embodied in acts of compassion and justice.</p>
<p>And I see your brothers and sisters wrestling with their identity, their sexuality, and their place in the church. Remember that we are all fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14), and that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:38-39). Let your love for one another be genuine, marked by humility, patience, and a willingness to listen and learn, even when you disagree. Seek truth, but let love be your guiding principle. As I wrote to the Corinthians, "If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing" (1 Corinthians 13:2).</p>
<p>Therefore, beloved, do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds (Romans 12:2). Let your engagement with technology, current events, and cultural trends be guided by the wisdom of Scripture and the love of Christ. Seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God (Micah 6:8).</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)</p>
