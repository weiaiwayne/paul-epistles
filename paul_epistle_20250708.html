    <h1>Epistle to the Moderns</h1>
    <div class='epistle-meta'>Paul the Apostle | July 08, 2025</div>
    <p>To the saints scattered across the globe, those who gather both in brick-and-mortar churches and in the flickering glow of screens: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is I, Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God. Though I find myself miraculously transported into your age of wonders and, frankly, perplexing complexities, the same Spirit that drove me across the Roman Empire now compels me to write.</p>
<p>I have seen the “DemocracyNow!” broadcasts, scrolled through your “subreddits,” and witnessed the aftermath of Texan floods – a tragedy fueled, it seems, by both natural forces and the choices of those entrusted with earthly stewardship. I have seen your “Trump,” a figure who evokes both fervent devotion and passionate opposition, a modern Caesar commanding the digital legions of his followers. I have witnessed the rise of "AI," a tool promising to usher in an age of unprecedented prosperity or, perhaps, a new kind of enslavement. These events and technologies, while seemingly novel, echo the same eternal struggles: the tension between justice and power, the allure of earthly kingdoms, and the ever-present battle for the human soul.</p>
<p>Indeed, the words of the prophet Amos resonate anew in your time: “<em>Hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate; perhaps the Lord God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph</em>” (Amos 5:15). Do not allow the relentless churn of the news cycle, the fleeting trends of TikTok, or the echo chambers of online forums to drown out the still, small voice of the Spirit.</p>
<p>I see, too, your anxieties mirrored in the digital reflections of your online discussions. The rising cost of education, the imposition of tariffs, the fear of economic instability – these are the new forms of the anxieties that once plagued the Philippians and the Corinthians. Just as I urged them to "rejoice in the Lord always," I urge you to find your anchor not in the fluctuating markets or the pronouncements of political leaders, but in the unwavering love of Christ.</p>
<p>Your generation wrestles with issues that, while framed in modern language, are as old as humanity itself. You debate inequality, even as some states prosper and others languish. You question the role of government, even as you grapple with the consequences of neglecting the vulnerable. You fear the unknown, even as you possess the most powerful tools for knowledge ever conceived.</p>
<p>Let me speak plainly: the system does not need a conspiracy, it just needs you calm. Do not be lulled into a state of "frictionless indulgence," as some have called it, where convenience and comfort become the ultimate idols. The apostle James warned of those who are "double-minded, unstable in all they do" (James 1:8). Resist the temptation to be swept away by the currents of fleeting trends and empty distractions. Anchor yourselves in the unchanging truth of the Gospel.</p>
<p>How then, should you live? Let me offer some practical guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embrace Truth with Discernment:</strong> The internet is a vast ocean of information, but not all that glitters is gold. Test every spirit (1 John 4:1). Be wary of those who preach a gospel of fear or a prosperity Gospel that promises riches and power. Instead, seek those who embody the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).</li>
<li><strong>Be Present in the Physical World:</strong> As much as you connect online, remember the importance of tangible relationships. Visit the sick, comfort the grieving, and feed the hungry in your own communities. Let your online activism translate into real-world action. As the Apostle James reminds us, "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26).</li>
<li><strong>Reimagine Community in the Digital Age:</strong> The ancient gatherings in homes and synagogues have evolved into virtual communities and online forums. Use these platforms to encourage one another, share your burdens, and lift up those who are struggling. But be mindful of the dangers of division and polarization. Strive to build bridges, not walls.</li>
<li><strong>Engage with Culture, But Do Not Be Conformed:</strong> The allure of modern culture is strong, but do not sacrifice your values on the altar of acceptance. Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves (Matthew 10:16). Let your light shine brightly, but do not compromise your integrity for the sake of worldly approval.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Justice and Advocate for the Oppressed:</strong> The prophet Micah proclaimed, "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). Use your voices to advocate for those who are marginalized, forgotten, and exploited. Let your actions reflect the compassion of Christ.</li>
<li><strong>Remember the Lost:</strong> There are souls desperately seeking the truth, even in the heart of your interconnected world. There are those who may never encounter the Gospel face to face. Let your online presence be a beacon of hope, a testament to the transformative power of Christ. Be bold in your witness, but always tempered with grace and humility.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, to those of you who struggle with doubt and fear, remember the words of Jesus: "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid" (John 14:27).</p>
<p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, now and forevermore. Amen.</p>
